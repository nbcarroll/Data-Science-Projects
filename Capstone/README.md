## Problem Statement

Since 1990, global cancer prevalence has risen from 54% to 64% ([Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer#:~:text=Global%20cancer%20prevalence%20has%20risen,(largely%20due%20to%20smoking).)). Exposure to certain chemicals in the environment, at home, and at work may contribute to an individual's risk of developing cancer. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Program are annual reports administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that track facilities that release toxic-chemicals which may pose a threat to the environment and human health.

## Goal

Our goal is to create a model capable of predicting whether a county has an elevated cancer rate based on data provided by the Toxic Release Inventory for Washington State Industrial Facilities and the Washington State Cancer Registry.

## Results

After testing many different machine learning algorithms, we developed a model utilizing the Gradient Boosting alogirthm capable of predicting if a county has an elevated cancer rate with 95% accuracy.
