# Data Science Projects
Hello! I'm still in the process of uploading some projects, so pardon the dust :-) 
### Soundcloud NLP Analysis
Soundcloud's mobile application has undergone many changes in the past year. This project helped to gain a better understanding of user's complaints regarding these changes.
### Linktree Payments as a Ticketing Service
Linktree's payment feature is one of the easiest for users, but is not the easiest for those receiving payments and is not natively designed as a ticketing service. This project was an exercise in data cleaning to make it usable.

### Reducing Regional Hits to the Supply Chain
An automotive manufacturer provided data from one of their manufacturing plants and asked us to build a model using machine learning algorithms that would predict which factors were the most important in asessing when a hit to the supply chain was likely to occur in the future. After reducing the size of the data set, we built a Random Forest Classifier Model that with 85.9% accuracy could predict when a future supply chain issue was likely to occur.<br>
