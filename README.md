# Data Science Projects
Hello! I'm still in the process of uploading some projects, so pardon the dust :-) 
### Soundcloud NLP Analysis
Soundcloud's mobile application has undergone many changes in the past year. This project helped to gain a better understanding of user's complaints regarding these changes.
### Linktree Payments as a Ticketing Service
Linktree's payment feature is one of the easiest for users, but is not the easiest for those receiving payments and is not natively designed as a ticketing service. This Project was an exercise in data cleaning to make it usable.
