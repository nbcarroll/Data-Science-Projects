# Data Science Projects
Hello! I'm still in the process of uploading many projects, so pardon the dust :-) 

## Academic Projects

### <a href='https://github.com/nbcarroll/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Carroll%2C%20Debnath%2C%20Geethasree%20K%20N%2C%20Majumder%20-%20%20Final%20Paper%20(Capstone).pdf'>Capstone: Predicting Elevated Cancer Rates Near Washington State Industrial Facilities</a>
In this project our group focused on predicting if a county has an elevated cancer rate as indicated by data provided by Toxic Release Inventory on Washington State Industrial Facilities. Our research uses various machine learning models which could be implemented by the government environmental or health departments. We explained which models performed better than others and the reasoning behind that. Out of all models Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting, Neural Network w/ Grid Search performed best. Additionally, we discussed some potential applications and limitations of our research.

### Airport / Airline Choice Analysis and Modeling
Presented written recommendations for supply chain optimization and other substantive business decisions based on quantitative analysis for airline clients operating out of two airports in Asia. Utilizing Python, Numpy, Pandas and Sci-Kit Learn, we conducted exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing and data mining, then developed logistic regression and decision tree models from passenger demographic and flight-specific data to gain a deeper understanding of the most relevant features driving a passengerâ€™s choice of airport and airline.<br>

### Reducing Regional Hits to the Supply Chain
An automotive manufacturer provided data from one of their manufacturing plants and asked our 4 person group to build a model using machine learning algorithms that would predict which factors were the most important in asessing when a hit to the supply chain was likely to occur in the future. After reducing the size of the data set, we built a Random Forest Classifier Model that with 85.9% accuracy could predict when a future supply chain issue was likely to occur.<br>

### Labor Market Analysis and Modeling
Built logarithmic models utilizing R from individual level data from the 2019 American Community Survey from California to examine the effects of education and race on earnings

### Mortgage Lending Decisions Analysis and Modeling
Conducted exploratory data analysis on data from the 2017 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the state of Delaware and built logit and probit models utilizing maximum likelihood estimation in R to gain a better understanding of the probability of loan approval across racial and ethnic groups.

## Other Projects

### <a href='https://github.com/nbcarroll/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Rekordbox%20EDA/RekordboxEDA.ipynb'>Rekordbox EDA</a>
Rekordbox, a program utilized by DJ's to organize individual songs in a database, is rich with metadata. The songs in most DJ's libraries comes from a wide variety of sources with varying standards of completeness in terms of metadata tagging. As such it represents an unclean dataset that's ripe for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. In this project, I explored my library.


### <a href='https://github.com/nbcarroll/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Soundcloud%20NLP%20Analysis/SoundcloudAppNLP.ipynb'>Soundcloud NLP Analysis</a>
Soundcloud's mobile application has undergone many changes in the past year. This project helped to gain a better understanding of user's complaints regarding these changes.
### <a href='https://github.com/nbcarroll/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Ticketing/ticketing.ipynb'>Linktree Payments as a Ticketing Service</a>
Linktree's payment feature is one of the easiest for users, but is not the easiest for those receiving payments and is not natively designed as a ticketing service. This project was an exercise in data cleaning to make it usable.
