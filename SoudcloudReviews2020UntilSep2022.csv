0,You need SoundCloud,5,6/26/2020 6:36,It’s by far the best music and created platform out there yes there are flaws but not many every week  you get a personal list of songs recommended for you from your listening history so you can discover more music and Artist you may like unlike other music platforms you can upload to and you can support small artists to help them grow it shows you the other side of music you have been missing out on my taste in music has changed so much for the better because of SoundCloud. You can find it or songs from popular artists today and see how they started you can’t get that anywhere else. It’s so easy to find the music you like and it will help you grown as a person to. I been using it for 1 and a half now and it gets better every day the best thing is it’s free and SoundCloud go is only 5 bucks it’s worth it. So all in all if you want to grown as a listener or start your career use SoundCloud.
1,SoundCloud Says Something’s Wrong with my Email,4,6/3/2021 20:06,"Hello, if you are reading this, please do. I want to tell you people that... Well... I don’t know how to start, but... When I was using SoundCloud one day, it randomly signed me out when I was just listening to a song. And I tried signing back in on my iPhone, but it said, “Error: Sorry, we couldn’t sign you in. Please check that you have already created an account and have entered the correct account details.” But it was the exact, and only email I’ve ever used on SoundCloud. I tried doing this a couple of more times, and it still kept saying it didn’t exist/wrong email details. I kept trying to sign back in for weeks, and it still doesn’t work. I tried to do “I forgot my password”, and when I inserted my email, it said something something went wrong. It’s not the password, or it would have said I put the wrong password. SoundCloud, please fix this. It says my email is wrong. And I am not making another account. I already have over 50 followers, and I don’t want to start all over again. Thank you, and other reviewers, for reading this. I hope you all have a wonderful day. Happy Summer!"
2,I did not give permission to renew this APP,1,9/22/2021 12:21,"I got a free trial. When that free trial was up, or even before it was up I removed it!! So why a month or 2 later when I buy an Apple pay card are you thieves going to charge my Apple Pay card? I don’t even have this app downloaded to my phone. I already reported it & I want my money back. This app was junk anyway. No offense but it even gives directions to go by to renew it. I never did. App is not even on my phone & they took it upon themselves to take $5-6 off of my Apple pay card. Now I have to wait 48 hours to see if they will refund my moneys?  I’m poor so every dollar counts. I notice I’d 1$ is missing. I reported it & if I do not get a refund I will be contacting an attorney. Yes! Over 5.99! Why? Because I got that card to use TJ buy more I cloud,  & not to pay for an app I am not even using nor is is downloaded to my phone anymore.  Wanting to all, do not download this app with the free trial. Because even if you cancel it & remove from your phone as soon as you get money on any card you are using, they will take money out!!!! I want a refund & I want it ASAP! I can’t even enjoy my phone because I can’t even put cash more I cloud because of this!! Can’t even do the update on my phone I need to do because I there’s no space or GB’s to do it! Could do it if I could pay for more iCloud"
3,Great,4,1/30/2021 5:17,"I been on SoundCloud for at least 5 and a half years and it’s awesome. There was at times bugs where I request songs to be in a playlist but rarely it crashes while doing so. Another thing is that there is a gimmick where there is songs that have like a “star” symbol or a premium song where you have to pay to listen for monthly cost. But not only you can listen to these premium songs, you can put download playlist for out of service ordeals. I would say the major downfall for this streaming service app is that I have to type the right perfect word for a song title, artist, or even a album in the search bar. If I misspelled a word, it would give me a totally different result of music or even no result at all. Therefore, I have to make sure to make more of a tension to spell the word of the song and such throughly. But other than that, I’ve been using the app at first free but I decided to pay monthly because I’ve been traveling more often now so it makes since of downloading songs. I recommend using this app. I’ve been previously using grooveshark until they shut down in 2015 then I switched over to SoundCloud."
4,"Unfortunately, just not worth it anymore.",1,9/21/2021 14:45,"A couple years ago I would’ve given 10/5 stars if I could. But nowadays, there’s so many advertisements that it makes listening not even worth it. I completely understand the reason for advertisements & for a long time, I could put up with them. However, I just used SoundCloud for the first time in maybe a year. THERE IS 2 ADS BETWEEN EACH TRACK. 
Back when I used to use SoundCloud for all my music, I’d have to put up with an occasional ad or two every 4-6 songs. But now it’s simply unbearable. I’m not exaggerating when I say I just logged onto SoundCloud & the first 4 tracks I played, I got 2 ads in between each. It was frustrating after the 2. Annoying after the 3rd. Infuriating after the 4th & I didn’t stick around for the 5th. 
I’ve been using audiomack as of late. I’d recommend that to anyone who doesn’t have music specifically on SoundCloud. I know that’s the reason I used SoundCloud so much. A lot of the underground artists would start on SoundCloud and their music would then find its way to other platforms. But I just can’t do the ads anymore. 
If you suggest paying for SoundCloud, why would I? The search engine all the way to the user experience is just terrible. Anyway, just my opinion. Happy listening, all!"
5,Lots of minor/medium problems,2,5/19/2020 5:21,"SoundCloud is fine.  I like that it’s free.  There are some songs, like Elise by The Greeting Committee, that used to be free but now require a premium for you to listen to.  I’d prefer if more were free, but beggars can’t be choosers.  Anyways, I don’t even know if that decision is up to SoundCloud or the individual creators.
There are some more glaring problems, though.  For one, when I try to scroll down quickly, the app gets really laggy, shows me one frame a second, and scrolls down incredibly slow.  It’s infuriating when I’m trying to go low down in my likes songs.
Another issue is finding when a song was posted or looking at its description.  Both of these are impossible on the SoundCloud app.  It seems that the developers only care about the computer version of SoundCloud, when it is much, much better as a mobile app.  I have no clue why you would focus on the computer more.  It’s not like I can carry a computer in my pocket while it’s connected to headphones or anything.
Also, when someone replies to one of my comments I’d like to be notified.  This one is just a small suggestion.
I usually like the app, but it needs major, major polishing.  Please update it!"
6,Amazing! But just one problem..,4,6/23/2020 0:50,"SoundCloud is an amazing app to use! I don’t really mind the Ads because I don’t really have any money to upgrade so I just stay with the regular SoundCloud instead of SoundCloud go. I’ve used this app for about 5 years now but since this year, I’ve started to notice a problem whenever I search for any music. Every time I search for music, I start to listen to it without liking it (because sometimes I forget to do that). But every time the song ends, or I try to look for a different version of the song, it always automatically skips to a different type of song that’s not under the title I searched for. This has been a constant issue for a few months so I decided to delete the app and try again, then it started to work like usual. But now, just a few seconds ago, the same problem popped up again. I don’t know if it’s a glitch in the system or just something that was included in the new update. But whatever it is, I’m not so happy with it. Other than that, that’s all I really have to say for the app whatsoever."
7,Fix the app,4,3/8/2020 2:57,"The following is complaints about the mobile Soundcloud:

Soundcloud is a good music app, not to lie. The ads are horrifyingly long, especially when you get a 30 second ad that you cannot skip. I can last a 15 second ad, but the ads are not skippable. Also another thing is if your new and you try to do the verification thing on mobile, it is possible the email won’t send at all. I’ve seen this on many other phones. Also, editing playlists most rearranging the songs don’t save until you repeatedly do it. Editing the name of the playlist I haven’t found anyway yet since. Another reason, are the visual bugs. Sometimes when loading in a song after an ad or so, the ad information shows up, but the song still plays. You can’t see the song until you close out of the ad and/or song. Also, a suggestion I’d like to make is you can verify your email whenever you want to, not while you’re editing your profile. Not trying to hate the app, it is pretty good, the main problems are the playlists bugs, and ads."
8,"not horrible, but not perfect",3,6/8/2020 1:41,"there are many minor issue about the app, like how you cant re arrange your liked songs and have to add every song to a playlist to control their positions (which i dont understand why thats even a thing). But the main 2 issues i have with this is the amount of times the app refreshes after its opened, to the point where it becomes the norm, and the amount of ads it give. The app constantly gives me ads in between songs and ruin the vibe, i could be listening to some sentimental music at high volume then get cut off by some guy talking about a brand new car i never knew even existed, exploading my ears by how loud the ads are, and not only that, sometimes it gives me 2 ads back to back, both 30 whole seconds, making me waste an entire minute listening to ads when i could of been done with the second song in the queue. many problems occur in the app, but other than that, the music is crispy, they give a variaty of different music every week, and it can play in the background. Its a fairly good app but its not perfect."
9,Soundcloud is okay... but could use work in certain areas!,3,4/1/2021 8:01,"soundcloud is great i’ve always loved it but there’s so many songs that i can’t  listen to because i don’t pay money every month??? there’s other apps i could download for music where i can listen to any song i want to, all of my friends and everyone i’ve talked to about it say that they don’t use soundcloud for this reason. my loyalty for soundcloud lies deep but i’m getting really annoyed every time i fall in love with a song and can’t put it on my playlist. i know for a fact that if this changed, so many more people would use soundcloud. or at least drop the monthly price down, i bet a large percentage of people that use soundcloud are 14-25 years old... people at this age generally don’t make as much money as the average person yet- due to being in high school and only having a part time job, or in college with a part time job trying to pay off student loans. not only would it make people happy, but it might be good for soundcloud’s benefits too!!!"
10,Great Music App!,4,2/16/2021 23:06,"This app is really great for studying, and doesn’t require a subscription just to use like other music apps do. Although there is a SoundCloud Go+ subscription to unlock more creator features and listen to premium tracks, the base experience is enough for small time creators and casual listeners. One feature I would love implemented is the ability to rearrange playlists that you’ve either created or saved. I like everything to be organized, and sometimes scrolling down to an old playlist I still use often, would be better served at the top of my list. One bug I’ve also noticed, is that sometimes the comments don’t appear, when opening the comment window. Sometimes two or three comments are listed by the little text bubble icon, but pulling up the comments just tells you that “this track doesn’t have any comments.” Apparently it’s been an issue for awhile, so I assume it will be fixed sometime soon. Thanks for reading!"
11,Pls change this one thing,4,1/24/2021 0:45,"I always used SoundCloud and it’s been what I use to listen to music since 8th grade and now I’m a year out of school. It’s always been a really cool platform and i don’t plan on stop using it. But there’s one thing that bothers me. VIDEO ADS. If an ad comes on while your on the app maybe u were jus on there to pick a different song and a video ad comes on, if u get out of the app the ad stops and u can’t play it to get to your music the only way u can listen to it and get to your song is by staying in the app as the whole ad plays. PLEASEE change this. It gets really annoying when I’m doin something while listening to music and then when I want to change a song get an ad then I gotta sit there and actually watch the ad to get to my song. I don’t mind just listening to it in the background of what I’m doin but actually having to sit Thru it is a bruh moment. Please make these ads able to play in the background of whatever your doing"
12,Disappointed but holds a place in my heart,2,3/27/2022 4:25,"I love SoundCloud coz I’ve been using it literally since elementary school, but it’s gone down hill. First, when you shuffle your playlist, it’s like the app has pre made shuffle lists from your playlist so it plays the same songs in the same order. I noticed this way too much so I tested this by writing down the sounds that would play, then a few days later I’d shuffle my list and it matched. That’s really dumb and annoying and I don’t understand why that’s a feature, if my playlist being shuffled like that is simply by chance then that’s crazy, but if it’s the app then why? Second, ads: before I didn’t mind the ads, but now when using the mobile app if an ad plays while you’re on the app, you’re forced to watch/skip the ad because it won’t play off the app in the background. That was not a thing a few years ago, why SoundCloud ): y’all are the OG and the prime spot for finding new artists and got exclusively unique songs from artists so I’ll always love the app but these reasons have caused me to switch to Apple Music <\3"
13,Casting Music Button is Very Broken,3,11/16/2021 19:42,"Much of my SoundCloud music listening is done through casting music to my multiple chrome cast supported speakers throughout my home the button in the upper right hand corner used to cast music is so difficult to press! I tap on it about 15 times before it recognizes that I’m trying to tap on it, instead of having it think I’m pressing around it (which causes my music to pause and play over and over again)

I’m also unable to adjust the volume on my speakers when connected through chrome cast by using the ‘volume up’ and ‘volume down’ buttons located on the side of my phone. I instead have to use the remote for each of my speakers to do so. I’ve used other music applications that allow me to cast music to my chrome cast supported speakers, that allow me to use my phone to adjust the volume on the speakers using the side buttons on my phone.

The last issue is that the music player for SoundCloud doesn’t appear on my phone when it’s locked. I’m not sure why this is?"
14,BUGS BUGS BUGS,2,9/6/2022 12:32,"Aloha, Okay, I’m officially intrigued. You are a whole company… I’ve been I college for 5 years for computer science/ software engineering. I had souncloud since I was in 8th grade, the only music app I’d use. 😂 A week ago I duplicated your “app” and made it exactly the same as yours when not published; though don’t get fooled by that sentence; I know my rights, fk add on to what I have just said. I have 4 years of study before college with experience. Why am I a Karen about this little thing? I did it ONLY BECAUSE, the bugs In your system AFTER THE RECENT UPDATE; Such as, searching for a song and my screen crashes. Trying to lick a song my screen freezes and I cannot click anything, trying to scroll through my playlist and it freezes; Not sufficient. SOUNDCLOUD was doing amazing. Comparing yourself to other platforms of music will not make you more successful. I think this is great feedback, for you guys to know, & also fix the bugs if Instagram can do it in a day you can too, it doesn’t take “much” money all the time it takes your brains in the company. Mahalo nui loa."
15,Used to be great listening on my phone but now...,5,11/11/2021 22:47,"November 2021 update: App is working much smoother! currently 4.8 stars. 

Pros: -helps me find a great songs -my oldest and trusty music app Cons: -on my phone (which I use 99.9%time now)not good anymore... sometimes frequent 1min ads like after 4 songs -new privacy policy looks like a privacy concern. -liked playlist (and longer lists) has lag problem where it takes 5min to scroll down. (iPhone) -music just stops when service stops (used to hold a few songs in RAM when you go intermittently offline. That was good, especially driving mountain roads) -app checks my location every minute. Draining my battery Interestingly It’s been great until the major update a few years ago and then continuously progressively making app worse/lagging with each update. Like why. Currently at 2 stars, I’ll update review later"
16,GO+ problem,3,5/3/2020 20:36,"So I was loving the app until I woke up this afternoon and came to see more than half my songs were suddenly GO+ when before they were free. I’m seriously freaking out because all of my favorite songs are now previews and I have no idea what to do. I tried to see if anyone else was having problems in the comment sections and it seems like no one else is having this same problem. I seriously do not want to switch over to another music app just because SoundCloud decided to make half the songs GO+. And I’m not just talking about 1 artist suddenly switching from free to GO+ I’m saying multiple artists songs I have saved are GO+ now so it’s not an singular artist I’m talking about. Unless these artist just happened to talk to each other and decided “Hey why don’t we make our songs GO+ for no reason at all!”. Now that’s me being sarcastic, but I’m seriously freaking out because I can’t live through quarantine without my music. Please SoundCloud do something about this and don’t just scroll by ignoring the people’s problems."
17,pick your poison,3,12/29/2020 23:56,"it deserves 5 stars but i can’t help but remember the days with no ads and no premium service, everything jus listening,  it would be really nice if you cut one of these things or at least chill out on the ads. Like maybe not right after the first song i play EVERY TIME!! it highly discourages me from using and i switch to apple music very quickly afterwards. By including a paid subscription and ads you’ve basically given apple the advantage as it’s pre downloaded on my phone and actually has all fully mastered music. I really want to see this app thrive but i think the money your making w ads and subscription is holding that back. 100% understand that you’ve probably ran those numbers thousands of times, but i truly think your fan base would explode to even greater numbers if you were to cut at least some ads, there’s just too much in the way of freely scrolling. However I have hope and rooting for you !!"
18,New update is pure garbage,3,6/13/2022 16:04,"I’ve been a SoundCloud user/artist since 2010 I’ve never once had a problem with this app until the recent update it’s so annoying. Nothing loads none of my tracks I liked load none of my insights load nor does the home screen load for weekly updated or new songs artist dropped. I already uninstalled this app 4 times hoping it was just an error but it’s not, I really hope the users/creators of SoundCloud didn’t delete my music or my liked tracks if they did then I’ll rate this app lower and delete it. Whoever’s genius idea it was to update SoundCloud for IOS like this needs to seek help they also did a horrible job. Why is it that all these people who had SoundCloud for years never had a problem, until this current update all these reviews from Users/artist that are leaving on this update is just showing the person who updated SoundCloud like this really did do a horrible job."
19,"Awesome app, been using it for years! But now there’s this one thing...",5,12/13/2020 4:09,"Okay, so I’ve been using this amazing app for a few years now and it’s been absolutely great, but since the most recent updates, it’s been having more adds and now when I’m trying to listen to my music outside the app, it’ll keep going for a while, and then out of nowhere, stop when I haven’t done anything. I’ve checked and is not my headphones, and I bet it’ll get fixed soon, aside from this temporary thing, this is a wonderful app that has the songs in a reachable, free platform when you can’t find the song you’re looking for anywhere else. It’s also an awesome place to find your type of music because it has such a wide variety of content! Amazing over all 🥰 have loved it for years 🖤❤️🖤❤️"
20,"Great, but...",5,1/2/2021 19:28,"Don’t get me wrong, I love SoundCloud. I use it way more than I listen to music I actually own. However, the ads sometimes ruin it for me. I don’t mind the audio only ads, I’m totally okay with those. The issue I have is when I manually go in to change what playlist I’m playing, THEY might show up, the accursed video ads. I don’t want to sit through those because I use SoundCloud in the background all the time. Problem being, videos get paused when you switch over, and don’t keep playing like audio ones. So I end up rebooting the app until it gives up, which takes several attempts usually. 

Basically, my suggestion to the devs here is either make video ads playable without requiring the app to be open, or, failing that, remove them completely."
21,SoundCloud is being slow/Loading Error...Tap to try again,2,3/16/2021 9:07,"I just want to say that I love this app so much, I use SoundCloud like 24/7! It is my favorite because not only do I love listening to the music I like, but I also happen to upload my own songs on there as well. My only issue with this is app is that it’s been lately being very slow on my phone. Whenever I go on SoundCloud nowadays it’s acts like one of those old computer machines that people would try to use back in the day, or it is also kind of like using an old phone because it runs very very slow on my phone. Also, I have been experiencing lots of loading errors on each song whenever I want to shuffle music on SoundCloud on my phone. Some work and then some just don’t want to work, and it is very strange because it hasn’t done this to me before. If there is any way that this issue can be fixed, please fix it so that I won’t have this problem at all anymore. Thank you so much!"
22,TOO MANY ADS,2,2/11/2020 2:23,"I don’t really write reviews for apps ever. I used to love this app and still use it occasionally but these ads are getting way too out of hand. I understand that the app has to make money but it seems like they are intentionally throwing ads almost every other song just to get you to buy SoundCloud plus or whatever the paid version is called. And it’s not like they are short ads either. It’s every other song a 30 second ad. I have started just closing the app out and reopening it and going back to the same song in half the time it would take for these repetitive ads to be done. I do not think that this deserves one star. I put it there in hopes that someone will see it and make a change. 2 years ago I would have given this app 5 stars but now with the amount of ads I would not truthfully give it more than 3 stars. 
Update: it’s getting worse. I am having ads stop music in the middle of 3 or 4 minute songs. This is not okay.
Later Update: ¿ALL MY ADS ARE IN SPANISH?"
23,love it but please update certain features,4,5/7/2022 23:36,"i have used soundcloud for years now, ive grown up using the app quite literally. i have bought subscriptions, told all my friends to only use soundcloud, etc. like i’m crazy for this app, but in comparison to how much easier it is to use on the website, it makes me extremely disappointed that finding new artists is just… not as easy? like the ability to hear the tracks people have recently posted or reposted in the last day from my following list. i find so many amazing songs that way, but i simply can’t do that on mobile. all the organized playlists are there which is cool & so i can still rely on “the upload” & “soundcloud weekly” but i need more. the playlists are only good for so long, please let me navigate your app for LONGER by making it easier find music🙏🏻"
24,Your new update is trash,2,7/25/2022 10:38,SoundCloud is fine it does it’s job better than most music apps but it has multiple completely stupid problems.1 I can’t play certain songs for absolutely no reason that I used to be able to play before.2 some songs you literally cannot find for absolutely no reason you will be listening to it accidentally remove from liked and then never see it again it’s annoying.3 get rid of the 13 million copies of songs idc if it’s a repost or not if the creators didn’t upload it it shouldn’t be there I’m tryna listen to new music and then the same song uploaded by 40 different people keeps playing which reminds me stop putting the same music in the created for me playlists why would I even click on them if it’s the same songs I have liked. All of this and more was already an issue before you remodeled SoundCloud so why don’t you guys actually fix your app instead of making it look pretty
25,ads after almost EVERY song,2,9/18/2020 15:20,"it’s ridiculous, i thought after i got a new phone this would go away, and it did - for a little bit. now, every time i open the app, i get an ad. if i listen to ONE song, i get an ad. if i don’t even listen to anything i get ads which sometimes stop playing when you leave the app, so you can’t play them in the background. i swear it didn’t used to be like this, i’ve tried turning on and off my wi-fi, clearing the app cache, deleting and redownloading the app, and nothing. for the record, i’m not opposed to the idea of sc having ads in general, it’s just that they’re so frequent i use the app less and less. i’m stuck to it because ive been using it for so long(large library) but that’s the only real reason.

also, there are some glitches, like text not showing in the search bar in night mode, and liked songs/playlists not showing up when you search for them. my main gripe is with the ads, months later as i update this, i’m getting one after EVERY song. sc crashed and as soon as i opened the app it came back with an ad. i’d give 4 or 5 stars if it weren’t for this stuff

and STOP with the same ads over and over
it wouldn’t be as bad if you had some variety but it’s just verizon over and over again, i get it, and if anything i want to use verizon less now

you really need to fix your ad program before everyone starts leaving."
26,Stop the SoundCloud slander!,5,10/29/2021 7:17,"I have legitimately never placed a review on an app ever in my 8 years of owning Apple products but SoundCloud has just held me down unlike any other app. My passion for SoundCloud runs deep as for 3 years now it has been the only place for my music needs. It is the only app that has the underground music I like along with the mainstream songs. I find very few songs I want to listen to are blocked by their premium feature and the ads are pretty minimal for a free app; So much so that I hadn’t even upgraded to SoundsCloud Go + until tonight (shout out that student discount🤝). I sincerely don’t get why people don’t use SoundCloud, it is a very well designed app that seems to respond well to bad wifi and just overall has intuitive menus. I love you SoundCloud and SoundCloud devs"
27,Constantly crashes in the background,1,9/1/2022 4:02,"The app has always been painfully slow, but it’s been worse more recently. Sometimes it takes so long to load that my phone just falls asleep. I have gigabit internet at home and I know that isn’t the problem. The app regularly crashes about half way through the first song I play about ⅔ of the time I use it. This problem has persisted from my iPhone 6S on iOS 9, through my iPhone XS to now on my iPhone 13 Pro on iOS 15. SoundCloud has never fixed this problem and the website is far more usable than this absolutely awful app.

UPDATE: the crashing still hasn’t been fixed with the new redesign, and the problems are even worse now. I can no longer stream anything on cellular data, it only spams me with SoundCloud Go ads whenever I try to play anything, and on Wi-Fi it won’t load artist profiles. It’s absolutely useless and I have since deleted it. I’ll stick to using the desktop site on my phone since the mobile site is also unusable."
28,extremely annoying,1,7/29/2022 6:34,"i've been publishing my music on here for 2 years and honestly i'm tired of this app. a lot of stats which i should be able to see are usually responded with ""error please try again later"" and proceeding to never function properly. don't even get me started on the ads. you have to genuinely sit there and watch it or else it stops. you aren't allowed to pick another song during YOU HAVE TO SIT THERE AND WATCH A FULL MINUTE OF IRRELEVANT CONTENT. bask in the glory of geico insurance i guess. i have stuff to do man. the hashtags they want us to use seem pointless as well. i feel they don't make a difference at all when songs i don't use hashtags on tend to get even more plays than the ones i do. i don't even know what my plan of action will be if i can't grow using their own sharing tactics. soundcloud is all i know but i've been growing to be fed up with it. they never fix problems or respond. i read bad reviews from 3 years ago that are relevant today. this entire situation is frustrating."
29,It’s amazing but...,3,3/22/2020 1:30,"As a long time user of SoundCloud I always been a fan and was my favorite music platform to use as it provided mostly all music and underground for free. But recently I have came into a glitch or bug were nearly my entire playlist is now “SoundCloud Go+” when they never were before. It saddens me because I tried to look for help for this glitch but the support and help system seems to be almost non-existent because I cannot post on the help center and when other people posted about the problem SoundCloud themselves said “their engineers are working hard to fix this problem and keep us updated” that comment was posted nearly 6 months ago and nothing has come of it and no word or anything I could find to fix this issue. So overall, it’s a great platform until you run into problems or glitches and from there you’re kinda on your own as the support system is close to useless."
30,Dissatisfied (Highly!),2,8/17/2020 1:37,"My main issue with this app is how often it crashes, especially when I attempt to search through various artist’ tracks. Consistent crashes occur on this app (my phone is brand new so I know it’s not a phone issue) and there’s barely any support for creators on this app. Creators have to download Soundcloud Pulse which is also another app that’s behind it’s times (you still can’t even check PMs that are sent to you). I shouldn’t have to go through hell and back to listen to my music, but with the way this app is set up I can certainly say that it is highly dissatisfying on nearly all fronts. Only reason why it gets 2 stars is because of the fact that it’s somewhat useful, but get this app with the times developers!!!

Update: The app is still crashing every time I open up someone’s “latest tracks” section which is pitiful. However we can finally see notifications from the parent app instead of having to go to Soundcloud Pulse which is nice."
31,please update or idk what i’ll do 💔,4,7/7/2020 3:27,"okay so 
soundcloud isn’t just a app, right. it’s a community. it’s the body of music heads. without soundcloud we wouldn’t have the access to leaks, snippets, and unreleased tracks that save so many of us. they show us a new side of our artist, so we’re not limited to what they put out. it’s like having one ear in the studio. makes u feel closer to the music u love. sure this is possible in other ways other than soundcloud, but sc is rly the best way!! 

u don’t truly listen to music if u don’t listen on soundcloud. but for a app which such a importance, it’s performance is underwhelming. i don’t even leave comments on the app store but i wanna see a change! the app crashes on the regular. it’s constantly kicking me out of my Go subscription showing me ads and making me “restore” my purchase which sometimes fails to work. the design is outdated and could really use a more modern redesign. it should look and function just as beautifully as apple music does. 

you should be able to use 3d-touch, add songs to ques, more easily navigate the “feed”, and much more. it doesn’t look the part of the role it plays. please update the design and functionality of this app to be more modern and appealing. it’s time for a change. up your game, soundcloud! we need you!!"
32,Finally time to switch to something new,1,6/13/2022 14:52,"I’ve used SoundCloud for years. First issue was me paying double the amount for a subscription because I’d been on the platform longer. Next was the glitches slowly arising on my favorite tracks. Now, the app is getting to the point of unusable and when comparing it to its competitors, it continues to push tech for the creators, but has fallen short on the consumers. 

Latest issue, I have to restart the app over and over again just to get a few tracks to play before ads get stuck in some loop glitch. This is when I have to close and RE open the app a few times… the new user interface was useless. Yeah, it is cleaner, but it’s unusable when it comes to functionality. The design is alright, but I’ve seen better ui/ux from people just starting in the field, so I’m done subscribing to SoundCloud and I’m pretty close to deleting it. Just gotta manually go through all my tracks to make sure I have them on another platform."
33,"Behold, my least favorite music app",1,12/23/2020 18:35,"Where do I start? This app is absolutely awful in the car. You’re just driving along, want to select a song and get back to driving? Good luck. Be prepared to jump through numerous hoops and complete a complex hand puzzle as you fight back the bugs and overall incompetence that make this app what it is. Random windows open, I get sent to the app store, sent to safari, everything but playing the song. Its absurdly dangerous to use on the road if you’re expecting ease and convenience. 

You have to manually save EACH AND EVERY SONG from your “Liked” list if you want to add it to a playlist. Its laughable to think I would sit there and one by one, go through thousands of songs to add to a playlist. 

If a song gets taken down for copyright, it still stays in your liked music even though the song no longer works which is completely useless. You cant unlike it, cant delete it. 

This app does everything possible to shove 2 ads in your face as often as possible. It would be understandable to see an increase in ads, while also seeing an increase in quality in the app itself but its still mind numbingly slow. Its at the point where Im considering going back to “MyMixtapez” and that app is HOT GARABAGE. Do yourself a favor and uninstall this smooth-brained app because the Devs are more focused on figuring out how they can bump it up to 3 ads at a time."
34,"Loving the new ui, but ya made it slightly to big",5,12/7/2021 13:10,"So im an og hayday user of SoundCloud and I’ve been using it essentially since it first existed, ive seen lots of changes with it, and how its grown. And regarding the new ui for the app I think it’s great except for the fact that you made stuff a wee to large, more specifically the size the songs take up when viewing a playlist, before you could see a lot, bow only a few, dont get me wrong this is actually a good thing now cause you can properly see a songs icon now, but you made em a wee to large and it takes to long to scroll through now. My recommendation is keep everything as it is but tone down the song sizes when appearing in a search or playlist by like 20%"
35,Can’t view artist pages!!,3,11/22/2021 9:50,"I like sound cloud cause I find artist unknown, unreleased music and it recommends not basic stuff constantly like mainstream audio platforms. But every time I purchase soundcloud go it starts lacking. The ads go away and then a new problem arises and makes it unbearable. I got rid of it before because it sucked with low service or wouldn’t play songs. It also recommended you only crap music and knows I don’t wanna hear what it gives me. But MY MAIN PROBLEM NOW, is i cant even visit artist page. I can’t check out all their music. And I’m paying for scGo and i Cant even have mainstream music? That’s terrible. Make it easier to follow people. Make it easier to follow and find artist to add without having to listen to every song please. I want this app to work but I’ll probably unsubscribe again cause there’s no change."
36,Something Happened,3,6/13/2022 15:50,"I love SoundCloud, been using for a couple of years now, but, I’ve run into an issue. Now, I was having trouble with the app, I thought maybe it was my wifi or digital data problems, but it’s only happening in the app. Now, I delete the app, and sign into my account when I download it back and all of my liked tracks on there don’t show up. On the website they do since it’s tied to my account and can’t get rid of, but the app is acting weird today. It’s not because of my wifi or digital data, it’s just the app itself. Please read this and help fix this issue, and before I did delete and reinstall it, I couldn’t search up any other track nor play older liked tracks that I hadn’t played today. Closing out the app doesn’t fix it, so please see this. Maybe it’s a one-day thing, I am not sure."
37,"New Update, New Problems!",1,8/23/2022 1:58,"I remember posting a review months ago that with this new UI gave way for Go+ users not being able to play ANY song they had downloaded, which was patched days later. But NOW, if I search for a song in the general search bar and it comes up and press it, it doesn’t start playing let alone go to the song. Nothing happens, even if there’s a song already playing. If I go to the settings and search in the likes or downloads, I can ascertain the song, and of course I can just hit search in the general search bar and see the main list. But if I search for a song in the general search bar that I listen to regularly and the 3-4 song panels come up to click and listen to, it doesn’t go to the song.

Everytime I update the app which is frequent, there seems to be a new bug that takes it’s place, or it’s fixed for a bit but then somehow a new update breaks the app, frustrating."
38,Great app! Some issues though…,4,8/22/2022 21:03,"I love listening to music on this app, but there are a few things that consistently make it a little harder for me to enjoy. The first is that the app doesn’t play well with the browser’s “Listen in app” button; it just takes me to the App Store instead of opening the app to the song I was on when I clicked it. Also, adding songs to playlists has some UI problems; unlike the PC version, I can’t search for a specific playlist, and there’s no indication of whether it’s already in a playlist I have. (Maybe a little check mark in the corner of the playlist thumbnail would help?) Other than these small issues, though, my experience with this app has been pretty stellar! I’d give it four and a half stars if I could."
39,SEARCH PLAYLISTS WHEN ADDING TO A PLAYLIST,5,3/29/2022 14:44,"Out of my many years using SoundCloud I have always wondered why there isn’t the option to search a playlist when you go to add a song to a playlist. The ability to do so is available on the lap top but most of my music listening is on my iPhone and I struggle scrolling through my 50+ playlists to find the one I wanna put the song in. I love SoundCloud and have the pro plan but this frustrates me so much cause it’s so easy to just add a search bar when adding a song to a playlist. Its been forever since the SoundCloud app came out and im sure someone has had this same issue. PLEASE GIVES US THE ABILITY TO SEARCH A PLAYLIST ON THE SOUNDCLOUD APP WHEN WE ARE ADDING A SONG TO A PLAYLIST. 

Sincerely,
All SoundCloud users"
40,Ruined SoundCloud,2,6/15/2022 21:36,"Ever since Google bought SoundCloud. The quality of the music has gone down and they advise you pay for every little service on a once free Artist platform. They did a recent update that makes the songs take up much more room making it more difficult to search for songs and the “heart” icon for liked songs, ISN’T EVEN RED! So it looks like you haven’t liked the song. The app layout is so preposterous since the update and it was ruined when it wasn’t even broke! No need in fixing something that was working perfectly fine but leave it to Google and their team to ruin all the nice apps with their control and crappy redesigns. I used to love this app back in 2015 and somehow got worse with each update. I’m here leaving a negative review in hopes to make a positive change to this app. Because I speak for the Artist community which is SoundCloud Users!"
41,It’s amazing but…,5,7/12/2021 15:13,"So SoundCloud is really cool and I like how you don’t get much ads and you can pick what song to play and it actually plays it and you don’t have to suffer through a whole playlists of songs you didn’t want to listen to. I also love that you can play the song of your choice over and over over again without many ads. 

The problem is the comment section. Lately there has been a huge spam of woman and pornography sending you links but DO NOT CLICK ON THEM cuz it will probably give your phone viruses. And another thing is people are writing a comment like “this is terrible” and then people fight back and then there is a huge fight in the comment section. And you would say to avoid the comments but they pop up on the song. 

The comment section has been a big problem for me cuz it is extremely annoying to see so much haters and pornography and then people cussing other people out. So basically: SoundCloud is a good app but if you don’t want your day to be ruined by other people then just try to stay away from the comment section. 

Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk :)"
42,Terrible update,3,6/11/2022 3:03,"The update is terrible. The loop track button no longer changes color when selected, so that makes it harder to see if it is selected. Songs in playlists now take up a huge amount of space, you can only see six songs per page as opposed to the many more we had before. Also, why is no more dark mode????? Only the settings in the app are in dark mode now, the white makes the appeal of the app disappear.

The app is fantastic for music, but you guys just killed the visuals of the app. The design is this childish, simplified thing now with soft, round edges. At least allow users to choose large font/song covers or the original smaller version.

Love this app, been using it for years. Please redesign the ui to more resemble how it was (or, give us options for the kind of yo we want)."
43,The Ads (please read this),4,1/30/2022 3:03,"The app itself is great. I’ve been using it for the past 4-5 years all without paying anything, and it’s been my favorite music app out of all the rest. The thing is that there are two ads in one go, and it’s really frustrating. I hate that after a good vibe to a song I get bombarded by ads that unnecessarily tell me about taking care of kids and at-home project items from a department store. It just really makes me feel mad sometimes because it happens too often. Yes, I do know you need money from you sponsors, but come on. I hate being constantly interrupted by repeating ads that don’t even make sense, and are about 30 seconds to a minute EACH. Please lessen the time of the ads, or make it less common to have so many!!"
44,My experience with SoundCloud,3,6/14/2022 5:11,So I love sound cloud I found music i would have never found or listend to without it it’s a really good app and I love that I can leave the app and turn off my screan and it will still play onto the cons the ads there not very many of them but they can get annoying and sometimes right after I listen to a add another one will play like 3 songs later or right when you open the app and click on a song  a add will start playing not to mention I got this odd update like the hole platform kinda changed and it refused to let me play any music it kept saying my internet was out it was not and it was so laggy and slow I couldn't do a thing so I DELTED the app and reinstalled it and know it’s acting fine and went back to the way it was before like that odd update? was not  even there
45,Just some bugs,4,3/19/2021 0:27,"So today I was cleaning out my liked tracks and removed some songs from playlists. Once I was done with that I went to chill and listen to one of my songs I have in my like playlist. The thing that made me mad is that the song I removed out of the playlist was still there. So I unliked it and removed it out of the playlist and every time I went to go get another song it kept on appearing back when I unliked it and removed it from that playlist. It’s like tug, For an HOUR I had to do that. I’m super tired now because I had to FIGHT with a song. Please fix this and this annoys me so much because this is my favorite music app and my other music app got deleted. So please fix this bug and I will fix this review to 5 stars. Definitely a 4-5."
46,play limit and battery killer,2,12/30/2021 5:34,"It used to continue playing until one reached the end of a list, but now it stops playing after each individual track and locks navigation onto only that track (no next or previous tracks). This app is not designed for continuous rigorous use; if you want to add things to playlists and like things and comment and pretty much anything, I can guarantee this app will destroy 1% of your battery life for each search, scroll, tap, and advertisement.
It seems that ads play on a number of tracks played rather than duration of tracks played. This is bad, since I'd sooner quit listening to music altogether than sit through another 45-second Instagram ad that I have already seen 46 times that week.
It bugs me whenever the list of ""latest posts"" by artists I follow vanishes. I rely on that list alone for discovering anything."
47,I’m a Paying Customer,3,7/31/2022 14:26,"I am an artist currently paying SoundCloud to be able to upload my music without limits, etc. - a pro subscriber. I love the platform, even with faults that have caused many to leave, and have used it extensively for years. So can someone please explain to me why the GO+ subscription is still stuffed down my throat in the app? Why is an entire tab dedicated to getting an already paying member to pay extra for some features I have, by now, declined dozens of times. A better idea would be to replace this tab with a direct link to my own profile, where I can easily see my own music and private tracks. Right now, I have to go through 3 taps to get to a slowly-loaded public-facing version of my profile. I know lots of users who upload works in progress, this would be valuable."
48,Why has soundcloud been slow & glitchy ?,3,7/31/2020 1:45,"I have sound cloud go(which is by the way a pretty expensive membership option compared to the OTHER music app choices in the app store) anyway, it’s been VERY VERY SLOW and glitchy. whenever i’m scrolling through the apps home page, my likes, playlists etc.. it takes forever to move sometimes the app even closes. please resolve this issue or I will have to cancel my membership because, if i’m paying 13+ dollars a month it shouldn’t have this many problems or be an inconvenience. other than the app being extremely slow, some of my songs that I have downloaded don’t even play when there’s no connection. that shouldn’t be an issue if you have soundcloud go. a little disappointed, please resolve these issues! for a better sound cloud go experience. thank you."
49,Uncut and Uncensored Artistic Expression,5,10/28/2020 22:04,"SoundCloud provides a platform for all genres of music to share its message of rhymes, rhythms, melodies and harmonies.  It’s where I go to hear the truth and the future giants...in the present.  Complete creative control is in the hands of the artists on a global stage...accessible 24/7.  As a user I can push play and let the algorithms kick in seamlessly providing what seems like an endless supply of music and artists that appeals to my own personal tastes.  The choice is always  available at my fingertips to take creative control and create my own playlists and access them 24/7 on any of my devices.  Looking forward to the next level of recorded and live joint sponsored event streaming ."
50,Good but has a few bugs,4,8/23/2022 22:29,I have been using this for about 3 to 4 years and i love it but a few months ago it stopped playing my music at of random so it will play for a few seconds before cutting off and it completely kicked me out of the app having to get back in and if I want to listen to a song on repeat i have to leave my account and sign back in I love SoundCloud but I haven’t been able to use it recently because of this problem I tried restarting my phone deleting the app and updating it but it still keeps happening idk if it’s some thing up with the app or phone my other friends says that they haven’t been having this problem but I don’t know if it has something to do with my account or not
51,what the heck went wrong?,3,6/13/2022 14:35,"I was just opening the app and about to play one of my tracks when the track wouldn't start. I had encountered this problem before so I did an in-app reload. but I still couldn't play it. So then I did a full iPad shutoff which has fixed a similar problem many times before but it STILL wouldn't work, so I updated it about 4 or 5 times, and the home screen wouldn't load either! no song that I started played. But do you know what still played? THE ADS and normally I don't have a problem with the ads but the fact that they still play even though I can't play MY tracks, is unbelievable. I am massively dissatisfied by this because I have been with sound for 3 to 4 YEARS. I hope you read this message and fix the problem.

52,"Edit Playlist ,",4,12/1/2020 4:55,"i Love soundcloud , but when i edit my playlist where we can choose , if we want our song on the top or bottom , make it an option so we don’t have to drag it up and down the screen ,it would make it easier to edit our playlist , and it would be a lot helpful , because if there’s a new song that drops , you don’t have put it in you’re playlist and scroll all the way down , to the song you want to listen to, that just dropped , but if you have an option put it at the top or bottom , before putting the song in you’re playlist ,that would be a lot easier,  but other than that , love the app  great app , please right back, and if you agree comments so this can happen people"
53,I love This app,5,10/21/2020 4:26,"Ok so i absolutely love this app first of all it’s free and very little ads not like other music apps it works great without wifi. Also what I love about this app is that they give you a private playlist on what they think you would like, ikr what that is amazing. Ok so the cons are this I don’t like how people can see my playlist like can we have some privacy on what we hear u dont like people knowing what music I hear. And also I hate how many girls comment on music and say “ check out some pics” like excuse me there are kids in this app do that like on Facebook or something. Ok so if you read all this thank you for reading this, this is my opinion and only my opinion.
- random person"
54,Love Hate Relationship,4,6/7/2021 12:37,"I love this app. I’ve been using it for about 7 years now. It has always been my go to for music. Primarily because I don’t listen to mainstream music. BUT as much as I love the app, I hate it. My iPhone X can barely run it. I get nothing but lag and stutters. It basically just locks up on me, ALL THE TIME. It makes it really irritating to use (the worst part is I pay for SoundCloud Go +). Even with downloaded music I get really bad lag. There’s no way I’m paying for the highest tier subscription and still getting such a negative experience. Regardless of the issues I will continue to use it. I have years and years of music saved here. Just work on the issues! SoundCloud runs perfectly on pc. Just get it to run well on mobile! Please. 

-Esthetic"
55,UI Overhaul is FANTASTIC,5,6/13/2022 5:26,"Bumped from a 4 star to a 5 star. The visual overhaul was done really well. My only complaint is that video ads require the user to stay in-app to play them, finish them, then return listening to your music. This can be frustrating if you want to multitask, but nonetheless it's really a small issue. The new sleek UI helped me to look over that to give this 5 stars.

Edit: Saw someone else mentioned in a review; the loop track button does not change colors when selected which makes it ambiguous. That is definitely something that needs to change (just making it orange when selected like the last update will do). Outsids of that, still a notable improvement!"
56,Sporadic offloading,4,6/21/2021 7:29,"So in comparison to other big name streaming apps, the free version of SoundCloud is great. We can select the songs, queue them up, and loop them to our heart’s content with much fewer ads. What bothers me is that sometimes the app decides to offload itself at the most random times and much more frequently than other apps. Sometimes if I don’t use if for a couple of days it’s still fine and then other times it decides to offload just a few hours or one day after I used it. I really don’t understand it and it gets annoying. My phone is a 6 and can’t update anymore so every time I offload I have to re-download from within the App Store. I also miss when I could listen from within my phone browser without the app tbh"
57,One minor problem,4,8/21/2022 23:03,"I’ve used this app for almost 3 years and Its been great, but lately something’s been bothering me. When I type in a song it would pop up under the search bar and I could play it from there. However lately it hasn’t been able to do that because a premium ad would pop up. I thought maybe I clicked on a song that required premium but nope, it wasn’t. I could play it anywhere else but from the search bar. 

It happens to every song I play and while I can still listen to the song from my liked playlist and stuff I find it a bit annoying that I cant play it from there too. Especially since it’s not premium. 

Aside from that the app is great and I like it"
58,SoundCloud app is now COMPLETE! 5 stars,5,7/6/2021 18:59,"I’ve been with SoundCloud for maybe 10 years?? Anyway, all the way back when there were a lot of features missing from the app vs online version. Finally the one of the BEST features is on the app:  Viewing comments on the tracks as they play!!!! 
Soundtrack is one of the most positive places on the internet. Most of the comments tracks are PRAISE and it is a joy to watch the comments pop up at certain parts of songs. However, until lately, this feature was only available the online version. I am so happy that it is now on the app because 90% of the time that I’m listening to SoundCloud, it is on the app now."
59,Just Plain Terrible,1,6/30/2022 17:27,"Something has to be pretty bad for me to take the time to write a bad review for it, but SoundCloud deserves it. The UI, Account Management and Subscription management is so bad it makes me want to study astrophysics and go through intensive astronaut training just so I can find other life forms in the universe and WARN them to never use this app. I have been charged for a subscription that has been clearly cancelled, not once, but twice! Not to worry, it should be something SoundCloud’s customer service team should be able to handle in a jiffy. Oh wait…..there is virtually ZERO customer service support for any issue outside of the generic Q and A page. Taking money from people for a service that they did not want or receive, where I come from we call that stealing. Who do I talk to now? Do I just continue to pay $13/month for the rest of my sad sad life for a subscription that I do not want?"
60,Great app but…,3,6/13/2022 14:55,"I’ve used SoundCloud for awhile now, and I really do love it, but there’s a few issues I’d like to complain about, the first being the internet, why does it take like Wi-Fi full bar internet just to play a single song? AND I downloaded it so I can play it offline, says error, really SoundCloud? I mean, I’m able to use every music app I have with that internet, but sound cloud is just too picky, and the looking up things, it’s caught my attention that when you look up something, it will either say “no results found” and then I load it again and it finds nothing, another thing is the looking up, when I look up things sometimes nothing related to it comes up, and lastly, whenever I do get a song, it brings up a different song, SoundCloud please fix these."
61,actually superior to other music apps,5,6/28/2022 10:11,"ive been using soundcloud for a while now and i love it. its so good and so much better than other music apps. if you want basically no ads for free, soundclouds got that for you. they even have unreleased songs meme sounds small artist songs and og versions of songs. plus the original song obviously. you also get to interact with other people who listen to the same songs and music you do. your able to create your own profile and follow artists and other people who are cool. you can even start your music CAREER on soundcloud. its that good. legit too amazing if you dont have it download it right now! you wont regret it at all 😎"
62,"Better and better, but…",4,9/6/2022 21:21,"These updates for iOS keep getting better and better. My only suggestion is to let us edit playlists, its a bit frustrating having to jump onto my pc because i want to change the order of my playlist or make my playlist private or make it public. Also an amazing bonus, would be letting SoundCloud Unlimited users change the audio file from our cellular devices, its not a huge deal, but as someone who has all the updated files on DropBox and can easily access from my phone, it would be very convenient to be able to switch it on the go. Other than that keep it up, once playlist are able to be edited its a 5 star from me.."
63,Good app,4,3/25/2021 1:33,"Soundcloud is a really good app for listening to music, i’ve been using it for years and enjoyed it. But one thing that still hasn’t been added is 3D touch support on iPhones. I’d love to start a playlist without even having to open the app, i know it’s a stupid complaint but it’d be a really cool feature. also, if you can’t cut down on the ads then can you atleast make them shorter, or skippable? 1-2 30 second ads in between almost every song is a bit excessive, especially when you have multiple premium packages to cover part of running the app. other than that and a couple minor things, it’s a solid app. when i see one or both of these things happen i’ll change it to 5 stars"
64,Why can’t I tap the songs I liked through the search bar?,5,8/14/2022 15:07,"I love this app to death, sure, but recently, every time I try to tap on any specific song that I have in my favorites list when part of its name is typed in the search bar, I instead go the SoundCloud Go+ subscribe offer page, and I don’t know if it’s an unknown iPhone glitch or not, but I know that I’m not necessarily interested in the monthly or yearly subscription plan, so can you please recalibrate the search function for the app so that I don’t always go to the subscription offer page anytime I tap a liked song in the search bar, that would make things better."
65,Needs a search bar for playlists,4,9/25/2021 7:26,"Great app but needs a search bar for playlists. My music is all organized based off vibe or genre with some of my playlists containing upwards of 500 tracks and with no search bar like you have for the liked tracks section, finding a specific song in a playlist is near impossible. I end up searching it on the search page but then when the songs over rather than continuing off my playlist it plays random tracks based off that search. Obviously not too big of a hassle but just a little quality of life suggestion that would make using the app more convenient and I’m sure most if not all users would appreciate it."
66,Pretty good app,4,3/11/2021 5:19,"Ok, so I’ve been using SoundCloud for about 3 ish years now and I can definitely say that the app has some quality. You can find most songs on here and even smaller songs and artists that aren’t on other platforms. My only problem with the app is that on IPhone it requires IOS 13.0 or higher to download it and I don’t want to like half a grand getting a newer IPhone just so I can listen to some music. Because my current phone is the IPhone6 which isn’t even an “old phone” but it’s current OS is only IOS 12.5.1. But since I am a fan and my phone is broken I’d probably be getting a better one anyways. TL:DR wish I didn’t need a better OS to download the app when it worked fine before."
67,I love SoundCloud,5,12/4/2020 21:10,"I love Go+. I love being able to live with access to the largest library in the world, and for that, I am grateful to the community for. I also really like how easy it is to discover new tracks based on what you play through the search; this is relatively new and I have discovered plenty music that way. I hope that in the future we see a redesign or much improvement to the UI and speeds in the app. I know nothing about app development but I do know other streaming service apps perform much better and smoother than SoundCloud. 5 stars because I love being able to have all these tracks downloaded. I’m a walking radio."
68,It’s good but,4,8/22/2022 21:42,"I’ve been using SoundCloud since 2016 but some issues have sparked up. Most times they get resolved once I restart my phone but one hasn’t been leaving. Each time I search up a song, before I press search, it shows the song I’ve liked and have been searching for, but now each time I press on a song in that search, it gets off the search and never plays the song. It’s annoying that I have to just type in the full name and have to scroll through tons of songs before finding the song or specific version of a song I want. It’s really annoying and I can’t always just resort to scrolling through a huge list before finding it."
69,Great App NOW KICKED OUT OF ACCOUNT,1,4/22/2021 16:51,"I love SoundCloud it’s good but it needs an update because mine won’t allow me to edit playlist . I can add new songs, but when I go to change the order of the songs in both my playlist , each time I try to save it says “error check connection”. So I use on wifi and Mobile data , both say error message when saving changes to a new playlist (I can add songs, but can’t adjust the order of the songs) . Please add new update fixing on iPhone 12 Pro Max

Now I have been logged out of my account after being logged in for 3 years . I didn’t not prompt this sign out of my account . I can not sign back into my account now , as it says I no longer have an account with all my music uploaded sad that this can happen . Probably won’t be any account recovery done either. Sad , will have to find another music app that fixes bugs"
70,Feedback for the app itself,4,3/1/2021 15:36,"I was trying to find a feedback/suggestions button or option on the soundcloud app, but couldn’t find one so i went to the soundcloud website and tried to find a way to leave feedback but when you type in feedback, it talks about leaving comments/feedback for tracks, which isn’t what i want to do. So i’m here to suggest that Soundcloud adds a feedback option for the app itself. Because what i was going to suggest was, a way to filter songs when you are using the search tab to find songs. So you can bring the newest, most recent songs to the front or you can have the oldest song you looked for, pop up first."
71,Best music streaming service.,5,11/1/2021 11:02,"It’s insane, because I’m literally listening to music AS I’m making this. An amazing way to express your musicality rather by listening or creating. All different types of genuinely creative styles of music. You can listen to music that is underrated, or names as big as Drake or the Beatles. SoundCloud is the way to go for music streaming without a doubt in my mind. I listened to my entire playlist thousands of feet in the air without any issues with the volume being the best out of any streaming service. There’s no such thing as perfect, well take this app for example. Truly a crime if you don’t have it installed by now."
72,Please read- ( Editted ),5,6/30/2021 3:45,"1 - There are some songs that i cant un-favorite and the song doesn’t work anymore and there are comments but when i click it there is none

2 - The app is good but please fix the detail ( Number 1 ) the song is Montero and the user of the person who posted the song on the app was iRoxss

3 - Besides ( Number 1 and 2 ) the app is good, and i will keep using it, but back to ( Number 1 and 2 ) whenever the broken song(s) turn on i have to skip it to go to the working songs, there are ( 2 ) and maybe more songs that are like that but the   ( 2 ) that i know about are both Montero by Lil Nas X , when i first liked the songs they worked, now they dont, i dont know if its just me but please fix it, it really annoys me.

4 - ( Editted ) I dont know if its a glitch or anything but i keep double tapping the home button and re loading the app but its still broken and every time i update it its still broken.

5 - That’s all, Bye! ( And i may make updates to this another time )

6 - ( Maybe just Incase )"
73,A Great Service,5,10/14/2020 18:05,"I’ve recently switched from Apple Music to SoundCloud because I knew this service would offer more songs (mainly unreleased). I also bought the Go+ version which offers offline listening and higher quality sounding music. I rate this app a 4 because I wish there was a way to disable or hide comments while watching the audio bar at the bottom, there are too many promotional and fake users (and if there is a way, I am just dumb and can’t figure it out). In the future I hope to see a tab for LYRICS because I find myself listening to words I sing wrongly. Overall, a great app!"
74,I love this app but it needs better features or a rework,3,9/28/2021 10:20,I wish this app had more features and other things to it. Like you can’t even search for songs in your playlist or such for playlist. It’s much harder to navigate and find songs and other stuff when you offline. The way you can search for songs is youved likes them. Why can’t i also search for songs that’s in my playlist that hasn’t been liked or anything. They also need to improve there queue system. YOU CANT QUEUE PLAYLISTS OR ALBUMS WHAT THE ????? They have a up next button but it’s very confusing and you can’t edit the songs you’ve queued or queue playlist. But overall i love this app. It literally has so much on it. but please fix these problems.
75,Amazing music app,5,7/31/2020 11:01,"I have been using this app for over 5 years, and I really enjoy the features and sound quality that is has, but one thing that bothers me and should be removed or something, should be that you shouldn’t need WiFi only for downloading a playlist or song for offline listening, because I don’t really have WiFi often, and since I work far away from home, I need music to keep me distracted from the stress of work, and I can’t listen to my music because I don’t get much signal, so please consider changing it to download them, it would be really great to change to that as well. Still my favorite music app thou"
76,my thoughts of growing up in the soundcloud generation,3,8/22/2022 21:02,"i think soundcloud has helped a LOT of musicians come up in the world, no matter the genre. so much to where there is even
a label of certain music titled soundcloud rap. my homeboy puts his tunes on there so obviously the app is very useful. beware though, if you follow an artist on there that releases a dope banger your addicted too, they can always take it down then your left with never being able to listen to the song again if they dont use any other music app or dont have that song uploaded anywhere else
for whatever reason. that happened to me. it is hard to find mainstream songs on there so just know it is more of an underground scene.
other than that i can dig soundcloud"
77,"Great, but latest technical issue!",4,8/20/2022 18:44,"I enjoy this app, as most of the music and beats listen to are only available through this app. It made me consider a subscription to pin tracks and listen to go+ songs. Way better than others, however, I’m not sure if this is happening to anyone else, but whenever I’m entering a song directly through the search bar, I tap the song, for it not load up and instantly start playing like it usually does. 

I’m confused as to why that may be happening. This has been happening for a day now, and it makes the experience burdensome, I’d hope this gets resolved soon. Other than that, I love SoundCloud."
78,There is a new issue.,3,1/23/2021 6:16,"Imma be honestly, I like the app but there is a problem and its starting to bother me. The app is sooo slow and I have perfect internet. I have 3 bars and no issue with my internet nor my date or even the storage of my phone. The SoundCloud online version is really good but the app is slow to load in the app and to search stuff. The loading takes like 5 - 10 minutes. When I go on my laptop, it doesn't go slow at all. You guys have to fix the app issue. This issue has been going on for at least 3 mouths. I hope to write this review to them to request to have a new update just to fix that issue. It bothers me a lot. I was gonna give the app a 1 star but Ill be nice and give a three star..."
79,Great App - Too Many Ads!!,2,10/10/2020 20:07,"Soundcloud used to be my favorite music streaming service. It’s a great app. Recently though there are so many ads the service is unusable. I just played three songs and had so many ads I actually sat down and did the math. For just under 9 minutes of songs I listened to I had two 15 second ads after the first song, a 30 second ad after the second, and another 15 second ad after the third (none were skippable). I didn’t even see if there was a song next or another ad. Doing the math that’s roughly 15% of the time that I’m listening to ads and not music... which is why I’m on the app. The only way I can even use Soundcloud anymore is on my computer with adblockers- which really stinks since I really liked Soundcloud."
80,🔥 best music app for artists,5,12/1/2020 16:47,"I strongly think this is the best music app for artists.  It’s great for getting your music out.  I can discover new music every hour with the ease of the SoundCloud app.  The recommendations are always on point.  You can’t argue with free.  Super easy to connect with people and send messages.  Great for uploading external links to other sites to generate sales and all that.  Plus if you pay, you get more access to play stats and history and things like that. All in all, if your like me and NEED to be able to listen and discover new music on the daily then this app is for you. 🤙🏼🤙🏼🙏🏼☯️"
81,Great but buggy,3,1/16/2020 12:10,So I’ve been using SoundCloud for bout a year and 6 months and yeah it had a few minor bugs like my ad not being able to move so I had to close the app or it would go back to the song I was listening to then go to an ad then replay itself but I had no problem with it until bout a week ago I tried using the app and it would close itself every time I try to go to my playlist and the app would shut itself down and it even froze my phone and I have an iPhone x max+ with the latest update and everything I even went back to update the app itself and it still won’t work and I downloaded the app again and it deleted my whole playlist so I found it good up until now .   P.s I still can’t open any playlist 😒
82,One of the best apps to play music but minor issues,5,6/13/2022 14:49,"this whole morning i was trying to play music on soundcloud but it isn’t working, overall the music and the options on it is great but sometimes when i have something liked and i want to play it it doesn’t allow me and i have to keep refreshing and it’s the same issue, like if it’s the full actual version of the song it looks like you can only listen to it for a limited time and that’s it. it doesn’t allow you to listen to it no matter how much times you keep refreshing that track"
83,I love it! There’s a.. new glitch.,4,1/26/2020 18:16,"I love SoundCloud! It’s great for background noise and just jamming out to songs in general. Recently, though, there’s been a new bug. I personally listen to creepypastas while I’m gaming, and since it’s usually on my phone, I have a tactic for doing so. Get in the game, swipe down on the top of my screen, and hit play. But when I listened to a particular one, it glitched and it’s stuck on 0:35 seconds particularly. You can’t press play, you can only stop it. It’s weird, it doesn’t play the sound it says it is. You can put on a totally different song and it still says it’s playing the song. I’ve tried deleting the app, reinstalling it, etc.. nothing works. Please fix this. Great app!"
84,Shyster Abogado,5,3/30/2022 16:07,"Soundcloud is what you make of it. It could be ridiculous and lame or it could be a really great way of supporting local artists and creating your own music to upload, save and share with a community of like minded people. There’s a boatload of really terrible generic rap. Not to worry though because The old Shystaroony here has uploaded some genre bending experimental rock music for you little whippersnappers. My music sounds like if Eddie Murphy was chocking on a ham sandwich and a donkey came and gave it the Heimlich maneuver just in the nick of time and Rick Rubin was there to get it all on tape. Check it out please....it’s terrible, nobody else has😉"
85,"Best app for New Music, Favorite Artist, and Podcast",5,8/1/2021 11:52,"“Sound Cloud has” •Great sound Quality •New Artist| “SoundCloud always has new Artist, and established songs to pick from! •Social Media A wonderful feature that allows listeners plus followers to find there favorite artist anywhere! •Always EXPANDING Seeing the times change, this establishment changes with the times. Now with podcasts, and more for a better feel! In conclusion, with all the apps out here that provide good sound,.. with “Sound Cloud I can’t definitely say it provides a really good experience for Music lovers, and More!” Sincerely Freckles of Genius"
86,Been using this app for years but..,2,5/24/2021 8:50,"It lags really, really bad if you have a lot of liked songs, even if paid membership to download songs. I do not have this problem whatsoever on other apps.
The shuffle is the worst part about it, very predictable “shuffle.” It’s been that way for awhile now, tried messaging customer service about it, no luck. Really makes me not want to pay for membership as much as I want to support this app and the artists. If I’m on the road, I can’t be looking at my phone to change the song.
Another thing is if you cannot download songs from that country that doesn’t allow you to & you don’t have phone service, it’ll just stop playing songs all together. Even if you try to skip to the next one."
87,"well it’s really really cool, but",4,9/28/2020 14:09,"There are way too many bots on the platform and they’re commenting on every track I make and my friends’ tracks too. I’m not gonna go int detail because it’s a bit inappropriate and kids could see this, but even if I delete the comments and block, report, and mark them as spam, then a different bot will come and I just repeat the process for eternity. It makes me and several other people uncomfortable. The other thing is that you can’t see descriptions on mobile, and since I make art sometimes, I can’t see if someone credited me or a different artist for their art using my/their art in the thumbnail."
88,Great app turned alright by greed.,1,9/8/2022 4:02,"I loved sound cloud and it’s a great way for me to listen to music I wouldn’t be able to hear anywhere else but when they introduced SoundCloud go, they started locking many popular songs behind a paywall with no other way to access them. I understand that they need the money to the app up, but there are other things they could’ve done such as adding new features to the app that would be worth paying for.

Updated review:

This issue has not gotten any better. Sound cloud now has you paying over 13 dollars a month  just to listen to all of the songs? Not only that but you can’t even navigate the app without getting at least 5 sound cloud go ads within the span of 20 seconds. If it weren’t for the wide variety of tracks I wouldn’t still have this app installed."
89,Established artist with over 8 million streams can’t even use this app,1,12/12/2020 23:01,SoundCloud if you read this I want you to know you need to focus on fixing bugs instead of adding new features. I am an established artist on the platform with over 8 million streams and I used SoundCloud for the business purpose of easily sending private songs to people and I can’t even do that because the app has been glitchy for MONTHS. It’s very frustrating and at this point I will just have to stop using the platform because this is an ongoing issue that has not been corrected. I can’t even listen to my own music on the app and you thought it was a great idea to get rid of the pulse app which really upset me because the SoundCloud app is still glitchy and now I can’t even send links to people on my phone. Please fix this.
90,Not great,1,9/17/2020 1:17,"SoundCloud is an alright app and I like the idea of it, but you shouldn’t have to pay to not have adds on an app that doesn’t even pay artists who put their music on their. I shouldn’t have to pay to listen to music ad free and the artists put their music on the app for free. When a 30 second non skippable ad comes up after a song it really just kills the whole playlist or track of songs you have planned out. It’s one of the main reasons the people who I’ve talked to said they aren’t using the app anymore. It seems sound cloud is in the early stages of a dying app. There is nothing about it that will keep people coming back despite their complaints about it. As soon as a decent amount of mixtapes eventually land on the main streaming platforms there will be no more need for SoundCloud."
91,great but not great,4,10/18/2021 5:22,"soundCloud is definitely one of the best music platforms ever but one thing in particular that I hate is that we can’t select multiple songs to add inside one playlist I do not want to add songs into my playlist one by one, and another thing I hate is that my oldest songs that I put in my playlist are first one i listen too, I want the newest ones on my playlist to be first because I want to listen to them because I just added them. so please SoundCloud add more features if you were to add them it would be a five stars but now it’s a four-star green music platform but I’m missing some good features."
92,“Listen In App” doesn’t work,1,7/20/2021 7:54,"Any time I find a SoundCloud page in my browser and hit the “Listen In App” button, it brings me here, to the SoundCloud app page in the App Store — not the app. I then have to open the SoundCloud app and search for whatever it was that I was trying to hear in my browser

 It causes a frustration because SoundCloud (for some reason?) limits basic features on the browser version. I can’t like a song, add songs to playlists, or follow an artist unless I use the app. If you’re going to force users to use the app, at least make sure that the continuity of the experience between the browser version & app is in working order. Or better yet, allow users to be able to engage with the basic mechanisms of your platform; or they’ll stop trying to engage at all."
93,There’s one annoying problem,1,8/6/2020 20:23,"I really would love to give this app five stars. It’s really useful. There’s just one problem. Songs keep disappearing from my playlists and liked tracks. I have a playlist longer then eleven hours, so its very annoying when one of the songs is taken out of it. After looking again, the track has not been put on private or deleted, so I’ll add it back to my playlist. It doesn’t happen super often. However, when it comes to the ‘liked tracks’ problem, my songs are disappearing faster than I can add them. I looked into this and it’s been going on for over five years. I really do think that you will have more users and more unlimited subscribers if you could just fix this one problem. I know I’d pay, but I simply cannot because of this problem. Thank you and please fix this!"
94,Love it,5,11/20/2021 13:36,I love this app this app is how I met my girlfriend and helped me with heartbreaks. The slowed sounds they have are amazing and I can never get enough of SoundCloud. Granted it does have its flaws but it’s still good and I would use it over any other app. But one thing that can get annoying is not being able to listen to songs that are GO+ which is a membership and if you don’t have it you can’t listen to good songs like good 4 u it’s always going to be another person singing or the slower and reverb version. In over the 2 years I’ve had it it’s been amazing
95,Make the lower plan of SoundCloud plus better,4,5/1/2020 17:05,Sound cloud is great for listening to specific songs you like but in terms of having full albums of your favorite bands you will have to pay for SoundCloud plus now their is nothing wrong with SoundCloud plus it’s just that it can be a little pricy which is why their is the lower plan of SoundCloud plus which is 5.99 a month this seems like a fair price if you listen to music all the time but the thing is you still don’t get all the tracks you want to listen to which to me seems a bit ridiculous because if your paying for music then you should get all the tracks not just some.
96,Too many ads!,3,9/13/2021 14:19,"I’ve been using SC since middle school, and the recent-ish (for about two years now) surge of ads has gotten annoying. I get back to back unskipable ads every other song, and it’s really starting to get on my nerves. Unfortunately most of the music I like can’t be found on other apps, otherwise I would’ve long since moved on to something else. Everything else about it is fine, I don’t ever post music so I don’t care about the posting layout, and I can freely make playlists whenever I want. Seriously, my only complaint is the ads!! If you like listening to ads about squarespace and tide laundry detergent every other song, this is the app for you."
97,Lacks features for podcasts,1,9/12/2020 21:58,"I downloaded the app to listen to a bonus podcast episode that came with the preorder of a book. If SoundCloud doesn't intend to host podcast episodes my negative review is perhaps unfair. Nevertheless, these two issues are especially aggravating when attempting to listen to podcasts:

The app lacks a skip forward 15 seconds / backward 15 seconds feature which are a necessary convenience for podcasts.

The podcast episode is unlisted and every time I pause for a significant amount of time (5 to 15 minutes) the app closes the episode completely. I then cannot easily open the episode from within the app, I have to open the URL again and click ""play in Sound Cloud app."" My listening progress is then lost and I have to find the place where I left off."
98,"Not bad, but there’s a few issues...",3,5/29/2020 21:56,"I’ve used this app for years and it knows me well enough, but when I lost interest in certain artists or certain song, I would try to unlike the songs/artists, but it would still suggest those artists/songs that I did not want to listen to anymore, and to make things a bit worse, idk if it’s just my phone for whatever reason, but the app decided to not allow me to control the playlist anymore, like I couldn’t swipe away a lot of the songs that I just did not want to listen to anymore. If that is something you had gotten rid of, please add it back in!! It’s irritating now without that and I had to find a different app to use for music streaming."
99,Love it. Just have one suggestion,5,9/2/2021 1:18,"Been rolling with SoundCloud for like 6 years almost. Some of the best music comes from the underground community. The offline listening is definitely worth the subscription. 

All I’d suggest is a feature that lets you know if a song on your playlist gets deleted or blocked. I have some pretty long playlists but I know them pretty well lol I listen to them like every day almost. Kinda hurts sometimes when a song I like gets deleted by the artist for some reason and I forget what the name of it was. 

Thanks for what y’all do"
100,"Love the App, but a few suggestions...",5,6/3/2021 2:51,"Soundcloud is an easy to use app where you can find nearly any song. It doesn’t have too many ads and you can easily navigate around the app. Some things I’d love to see though are the ability to customize the cover picture of our playlists and to be able to loop our playlists. I’d also appreciate it if you could allow us to rename our playlists! I don’t see an option for that. Overall, I love Soundcloud and I’ve been using it for over a year without any problems! Five stars! :)"
101,Bugs,5,5/6/2020 3:02,"I love soundcloud. I've been a user since around the first launch of this app. I use this music platform everyday as my go to music platform. Although i have noticed lately since i have updated it constantly crashes in the background when listening to music or changing songs. I really hope you guys will fix this in an upcoming update. As much as I love this app, it is very inconvenient for this to crash so much, as i use this to listen to music while driving. Hope you developers fix this soon. Overalls this is going to still be 5 stars even though it crashes. Sincerely,
Sid."
102,I love SoundCloud but not the paid version :/,4,5/17/2022 22:32,"I recently paid to have the SoundCloud plus version so I could have music offline, and without commercials. I have not been able to make it not download every single track associated with the tracks I like. So I’ve got a whole phone filled with stuff it downloaded by association. I’ve tried to figure out how to fix it, and it won’t let me take all the extra stuff off without also losing the stuff I love. I unsubscribed, it’s not worth the time to try to figure it out… nor all the money it’d cost for an app that doesn’t really work. I’ll keep my free version 🤷🏼‍♀️"
103,Overall good,4,8/29/2021 5:30,"The app is overall good. A lot of artists that can’t be found on other platforms. My only complaint is the ads. They’re so repetitive and extremely annoying due to how frequent they pop up. 
Not only that, but getting TWO thirty second ads? It’d be understandable if you got them once in awhile and no other ads, but it’s constant. I will literally close out of the app and go back in just to avoid having to sit and listen to the same ads over and over. 
I use apple music, but like I said there are a lot of genuinely good artists/songs that can’t be found on other platforms."
104,Works Well for the Most Part,4,6/7/2021 2:04,"The app works very well and hardly ever has any issues. What I do not like is that it appears to access the internet to open downloaded playlists for some reason. This makes it where when I am out and about, sometimes it takes a while to open a downloaded playlist or sometimes doesn’t open when my signal is weak or if the phone is trying to connect to some wi fi. The whole purpose of downloading the playlists locally is to not have to connect to the internet to listen to them I thought? Other than that frustration, works great."
105,I love SoundCloud but....,3,7/17/2020 15:34,"I absolutely love SoundCloud,  I have amassed a fairly large collection of music that I literally do not go one day without listening too. The app has put me on to so many new artists but also at the same time it’s super frustrating.

I purchased the subscription so I can get rid of those rage inducing ads only to be met with rage inducing crashes. I’ll be listening to my favorite playlist one minute then the app with crash or force reset out of the blue. Sometimes it even refuses to open entirely after a crash. It is soooooo annoying, I have seriously considered canceling my subscription. What’s the point of paying for something that doesn’t work properly? I could save myself the hassle and money."
106,"Phenomenal app, one thing though",5,1/12/2020 5:39,"Music is very important to me. I’m not a producer my self, though listening to it “awakens” me per say. Soundcloud has slowed me to find many great songs and listen to many others I’ve enjoyed over the years. My only problem is that Go+ is just unaffordable. 13 dollars a month just seems a bit much In my opinion. Having an ad free experience and being able to listen to certain songs should cost that much. Just think, if it costs less, people would be more willing to buy it and you would most likely gain much more money in the long run :)"
107,Policy by Kindergartners?,1,6/19/2020 5:35,"A long time Pandora user I decided to give SoundCloud a listen. The site seemed a little confusing but first time user so when in doubt go to the search tool, I searched out a song press play got about eight seconds of the song next prompt PlayStation the station is based off of the song OK. 
Holly Molly, the song that this station is based off of is by Kenny Chesney, but when I hit play the last thing I heard was Kenny Chesney or any country music for that matter or any music from this country USA. The music that came pounding through my AirPods was obviously a techno/dance electronica music in Arabic not one English word in fact all the other songs behind the title Kenny Chesney were all aribic. 

Next I go to Report station as Having Nothing to do with title song..., and would you look at that!! Mrs Lee’s kindergarten class, well hello Mrs. Lee‘s kindergarten class I’m here to report someone  who’s lying, oh no mister, you can’t Report a Verified user, hahaha What, hahaha, oh your Serious!! 
So get Verified & do whatever you want, no one can say or do anything about it!! LOL. 
Well this was a waste, Back to Pandora, 
Thank You Sound cloud & the kindergartners making policy over there for making this decision so easy to make!!"
108,Rate on app,5,1/22/2020 22:07,I would give it a 5 because there are rarely adds and you can make any song you want on ur playlist but I think you guys could add more songs that we can listen to fully instead of just being able to have a preview and I like this because the app quality is good and u can find a lot of songs and I like how you can just listen to recently played songs and that you guys have a recommendation songs that actually match songs that I like. And I like how freely people can be on this app posting their music that they create. Good job thanks for your guys time.

110,Love it but…,4,7/29/2021 7:58,"Love this app to bits! But I wondering if you could maybe remove those sex bots? Usually the ones from comment sections, girls that are spamming porn link and a bunch of inappropriate emojis and 18+ stuff. It’s very uncomfortable and inappropriate as some youngsters could use this app :( and also, PLEASE decrease the skip time for the ads? I understand that it’s like saying “use SoundCloud Plus for free” idea but I can’t stand how the ads are so long and I have to wait 15 seconds to skip them, please at least 5 or 7 or even 10 seconds is fine, but not 15, that’s almost 20. Basically just show the show the whole ad then :("
111,Clunky UI,4,12/21/2020 19:31,"I love this app and what it has to offer but when I scroll down a bit in my reposts or likes it starts stalling and slowing down. Also I wish my reposts were more readily accessible instead of having to go all the way into my profile.
Sometimes pulling the screen down to refresh the page doesn’t work either.
I’m not sure if it’s because my phone is slow or old, I got this iPhone XR in Aug 2019. Or if it’s because I have so many songs stored on the app. Maybe the cache?
Any response or update would be greatly appreciated for this. Great work and collection of tracks in general though!"
112,A Little Issue,4,2/29/2020 19:03,"I love SoundCloud, but it’s a bit rough around the edges. Just recently I had accidentally unliked a song and wanted to reorganize as I have an order in which I like to listen. However, to do this I had to go back from where the song was removed and continue to u like and relive songs until it got to that point, and up during this I got put into a like block (which is quite irritating for this purpose)
I think having a way to shift and move songs around in the like playlist would be a very nice thing to add, it will save time and the struggle of trying to reorganize our liked tracks and stop any unnecessary liking blocks."
113,App Crashing,5,4/17/2020 21:51,Love SoundCloud to the max - always have used it & have always used it to stream - download music & music has found me ❤️ never have had issues but now anytime I stream my favorite music or new music the app slows down & then crashes - I pay monthly for SoundCloud go+ & have been for quite sometime now - still recommend SoundCloud to all music listeners & upcoming music listeners but would love if app would not crash . I’m huge into the music scene & would love to stay on top of the game . Thank you SoundCloud for all the memorable times - but please help me fix my app so I can listen to my music 🎵
114,JUNE UPDATE IS HORRIBLE,1,6/23/2022 23:08,"I’ve paid for the premium subscription for years. I use this app more than any other music listening app. But this new update is atrocious. It has frozen, force closed and lagged more in the last week or so than it has in the 2 years I’ve religiously used the app. There was nothing wrong with the older version. You guys blew up everything up with this big bubble style as if we’re 80 year olds that need to adjust the zoom on the monitors to 150%. Also, It runs really slowly now. Trying to do something simple like adding a song to a playlist goes so slowly and half the time, attempting to do basic functions on the app will cause it to freeze and you have to close the app and restart it. FIX IT and hire new techs because this coding is absolute trash."
115,Good but frustrating,3,9/4/2020 10:15,"The app is good, but for the life of me, I can’t figure out why apps such as these have such horrible search engines.   

For example, why is it so hard to have a search ability on a particular page I’m following.   If I only want to search the content from a particular account I’m following, it’s a no go.   

In addition, giving a function to filter my search requests to only the individual accounts I am following.   Perhaps searching for particular posting for a particular timeframe.   

For an app with significant amounts of data, the search engine lacks.  Please do better.

There is also an issue with not being able to get rid of a recording that I mistakenly clicked on.  It would be nice if there was a setting that allowed me to change the pattern at which something I hit starts to play.  It could give me the option to double or triple tap, confirm that I want to play, or swipe in a certain direction.   

Another alternative would be to give me a option to stop and remove recording.  Adding a dislike button is also beneficial."
116,Lost all my account & playlists multiple times,1,7/10/2022 15:35,"Soundcloud please contact me

Every one in a while out of the blue, I open the Soundcloud app, and it tells me to sign in. Normally it never signs me out, but I was not bothered when it simply asked me to sign in. So I did, and it said: error, cannot sign in. I tried multiple times, and I could never get into my account again. (btw I only have one password across all websites its not like I forgot password). Now I have lost all my playlists and all my saved songs. A few days ago, I had just purchased Soundcloud GO+ and now I cannot get into my account and use my subsciption. Since this has happened to me twice, there are no other email adresses I can log in as. Soundcloud please read this and fix. I am very upset."
117,App has gotten slow over the years,3,12/9/2020 13:31,"Not sure why but this app has gotten slow and laggy the more it is developed. I was using SoundCloud Pulse to check notifications because the navigation on the main app is so funky/laggy, but now pulse is discontinued. To me it is not intuitive to get to your profile, look at your tracks, check out stats, or insights on the SC app. I love SoundCloud but I think it was a mistake to get rid of Pulse. It was the only way for me to quickly check the status of my page. Now I’ll be using other apps to do that. I hope they can figure out a better UX for 2021 and hopefully cut some of the fat to speed things up on this app."
118,charged me when i canceled subscription.,1,10/29/2020 13:41,"first off. i only have one soundcloud account. 
i use to have soundcloud go but canceled it a long time ago. 
i tried renewing it again for the $6.00 sub i use to use but then it said “wrong user subscription” then asked me to sign out and sign into the “account” that has the subscription. 

it went ahead and charged me for 6.00. i figured it would. i canceled that subscription. i figured it might’ve just glitched or something because it made me go to my settings and enter my card again. so i tried the go+ with the free month trial. i’ve never used the $12 one before so i still had the 1 month free deal. 

tried it and same thing happened and wouldn’t let me use it on my account. i canceled the subscription less than 10 minutes after purchasing it. but instead of having one month free, it went ahead and charged me the $12. so now i’m down about $18-$19 and i got nothing in return. 

and it’s impossible to even find customer support other than FAQ links. until i can get either a refund or the subscription i paid for, this review will stay and i will never subscribe again."
119,Bugs/glitches,5,6/5/2022 3:17,"When I scroll down my liked songs it always  crashes my app, I can't stay outside the app for even a couple of minutes without it completely crashing maybe it's because of the fact that I have 5000+ liked songs but in all honesty this needs to be fixed asap, overall I really do love SoundCloud I've been using it since I was 9 it has altered my way of viewing music it has also changed my music taste astronomically I love all the unique artists but this bug is really annoying"
120,Improvements,3,7/15/2022 3:59,I love sound cloud I’ve been using this app for years and it’s came a long way from we’re it started but one thing I will say that has been bad for a long time is the comment sections when someone replies to my comment and I get a notification I shouldn’t have to scroll through all the comments too find my comment and the responses I should be able to click on the notification and it being me straight to the comment and replies especially when there’s people being really toxic to your comment for no reason it basically makes it harder to report someone’s account for harassment through the comments
121,No good anymore,1,3/22/2020 16:48,"Soundcloud was my absolute favorite music app. I could play all my favorite songs on it and it was great. But a few days ago, soundcloud made all the official albums Go+. So now I am not able to play any of my favorite songs without having to pay 12 dollars a month. Now I have no choice but to try out other music apps because me myself would not pay 12 dollars a month just to listen to music. Before everything went Go+, I was able to listen to almost every song for free and it was great I would have given it a five star. But now almost every song is Go+. Out of the hundreds of songs I had favorited on soundcloud, only 5 of them weren’t Go+. So, I really do recommend this app, but only if you’re willing to pay 12 dollars a month."
122,Would love a homescreen widget for iOS 14!,4,9/19/2020 20:24,"I love the SoundCloud app. So much great music to discover.
The only real problem I have with the app itself is that there’s no search bar in downloaded albums. Every time I want to listen to a playlist or album I have to scroll through my entire library which is impractical and annoying. Please add a search bar to “Albums and Playlists” dear SoundCloud team!

Also now that we have homescreen widgets with iOS 14 it would be great to have a SoundCloud widget with which I can skip or like songs without having to go into the app. Hope this can be done."
123,Please improve playlist performance,2,1/13/2020 14:31,"There are a poor ux in playlist. Rearranging playlists isn’t always live, even when a song has adjusted, it doesn’t show immediately. There’s also the issue when the buttons of arranging the songs. I currently have a playlist that is displaying twice, but if I remove one playlist it removes both playlist. Lastly, please add the feature of being able to duplicate playlist, so that uses your app to create playlist for classes they teach such as SoulCycle, Corepower or Barry’s can use as a baseline to build feature playlists. By including this feature, you can gain users that uses and pays for the plus app for work. If you want to do usability testing or want to customer interviews. I am open to it!"
124,Stop deleting my accounts,1,1/12/2020 3:17,"I let it slide the first time when I had already liked 400+ songs and now I made another account I can’t log into and it always says I can’t connect my email to a soundcloud account, I’m tired of it and give me my accounts back, fix your app .

I try signing in and it says the password is wrong but email is right, then I press “send password reset” and it doesn’t send me anything. The email I used to create this SoundCloud account is still active and working, I try signing in with this said email and it says there is no account connected to this email but when I try creating a new account with the same email it says there already is a soundcloud account usin this email. Don’t give me advice on how to get it back because it doesn’t work , just give it back."
125,Could improve,3,3/15/2021 20:10,"Overall it’s really great, but it’d be nice if there was a search feature for the playlists when adding a song to them, as it’s really inconvenient to have to scroll through them all each time to find a specific one. Plus, you have to go through the process multiple times if you want to add a song to more than one playlist. 
Then, there’s the part where it randomly stops playing every 30 seconds and glitches out in a way. It ended up effecting the rest of my phone to the point where I had to restart it. That was a week ago, and I haven’t been back on since then."
126,First Cipherian,5,5/11/2021 19:32,"This app is superb! I just grow more and more in love with it, and that is because of the music I have discovered in it that can’t be found anywhere else! I am inspired so much by SoundClouds content that I will soon be a content producer. I use only the free access to this app, and I get this much value from it. If everyone used this app it could be the valuable social media platform  in history, and the most powerful company on the planet. There is no better way to unite people but through the energy frequencies that bind them!"
127,A few problems,4,5/1/2022 18:57,"The app is nice and simple to use but a problem i ran into is i can’t edit the playlist name on my phone but instead i have to on onto my computer to do that, the same goes for editing playlist photos i find that inefficient and its a partial waste of time to open the computer to just change the the picture for one playlist or the name. I hope in a future update you’ll make it to where we don’t have to open our computers to Edit playlists. I’m sorry if this review doesn’t make sense as i rarely type reviews."
128,Great platform but missing a KEY feature on the app,3,12/22/2020 7:34,"I love using SoundCloud to discover new artists and upload mixes of my own. However, there is one key feature the mobile app lacks and that is the ability to view a track’s description. Artists spend time to write out their descriptions to provide listeners with more insight into the track and share any other relevant information pertaining to the track. Not being able to view this on the app is a real issue here. Please put this on the priority list for your development team because I know there are plenty of users who feel the same way about this!"
129,Cant log in,1,6/7/2021 13:59,"So I just downloaded the app and was excited to make an account and log in. But I’m not able to. I created an account using a google email, put in my age and gender, and clicked next. But instead of taking me to the next step or allowing access to the app it brought up a little error message saying “sorry, we’ve had a server error. Please try again.” So I did try again and got the same results so I tried creating an account eh e regular way but it already had my email attached to a account so that didn’t work. I even deleted and re downloaded the app and it still won’t let me sign in. 

Would love to give this app a better rating if it deserves- but at the moment it’s a one star because of those log in issues."
130,Pretty good!,4,4/7/2021 20:16,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for music listening for about a year now and so far I really like it! It does have some problems, like all the bots in comments, or just being buggy, but nothing that bothers me that bad. I don’t mind the ads, most of the time there aren’t that many, so they’re fine. I love being able to keep up with my favorite artists and listen to what I want. Overall it’s a pretty good place to listen to music, besides being a little buggy here and there. Hopefully SoundCloud will keep improving and I will keep using it as long as it stays good! <3"
131,"Fine, but occasionally buggy.",4,3/26/2021 18:13,"Main issue is the bug preventing me from seeing listening history. The most recent four show up just fine, but the “see more” button doesn’t work. I haven’t found a remedial fix for this yet.

Another issue is that SoundCloud Weekly sometimes gets stuck on the same selection for weeks at a time, though that can be fixed by uninstalling the application and reinstalling it.

Other than that, it’s fine for what it’s meant to do. I won’t go into all the stuff like SoundCloud Go+ and the dumpster fire that entails."
132,This could be bugged,2,8/5/2020 5:23,"When I first got this app, I absolutely loved it because I would listen to all the songs while I would write but then I noticed that almost none of my pictures in my camera roll were doubled. So I deleted the doubles, and then they wouldn’t show up, they were blank. After a while, I saw that they had changed from black to white and doubled again. The day after that, the photos that didn’t show up were gone. Everything from January, which is when I got my phone, to now. I don’t know if it’s the app, or if my phone is hacked, but it’s probably both. Yesterday I went to the park to take pictures with my friends dog, and the next day half of them were gone. I deleted SoundCloud, and I’m sad now."
133,"Love it, but the ads…",4,9/12/2021 23:53,"this app is great for listening to unreleased music by artist you love. or if you want to pay for a subscription i’m sure it would be great aswell. however, there’s 1 or 2 30 second long ads every 3-5 songs, the ratio of time you’ll spend listening to music vs listening to the same ads over and over again is terrible. i get it they gotta make money but cmon bro, often times i find myself just closing the app and reopening it or turning my volume off while the ads play because it just kills any and all vibes. aside from that it’s great tho"
134,Good app one thing,4,1/1/2021 0:10,"Ok so overall the app is amazing and very helpful for songs I can’t find on Apple Music but one thing is, is that sometimes after a while my tracks I’ve added to playlists disappear and I have them in my watch history but it doesn’t let me listen to them saying “Tap to re load” and when I try to re add them to the playlist it doesn’t like me saying “(Blah blah blah what ever track you have) can’t be added to this playlist try again later. I don’t know if this happens to others it did happen to my friend so I’m guessing it does but it’s annoying."
135,Having some issues…,3,7/13/2021 18:17,"First off I love the app, but despite the regular updates I still find it to be quite buggy. I’m not sure if it’s my phone causing the problems but I have several songs on my like list that no longer play - when I unclick the like button the songs just pop up at the top of my playlist and it has become increasingly frustrating as those songs freeze my playlist until I refresh the app. Another issue is that when scrolling through playlists the screen often freezes, even when I go at a slow pace. Besides these minor issues the app is great."
136,SoundCloud,4,6/12/2021 23:11,"The app is good. I can post my music on there and it works, but no I think they need to add a little more space of free songs you can post. Because for me, it feels really little. Also a lot of people there are bots. I think they should suggest like smaller people who make a lot of songs more. There are a lot of thirsty girls on there too. They say some weird stuff and tell you to go to this website and stuff. I really think SoundCloud needs to work on banning them. But overall, it’s a good app to post your music. Just a couple of changes would make it better."
137,glitch???,2,8/25/2022 4:22,"I have used soundcloud for about a good 4 years, to say the least. I've made many playlists and everything was working fine until today. I've had these playlists for a long time and spent a lot of time adding songs into playlists and stuff like that. I went on the app to look at my playlists and the playlists all say that there are no tracks added, even though there are many tracks added to each and every playlist. none of my songs load. i've deleted and re-installed the app. I've logged in an out of the app. I've restarted my phone. This has happened once before. please respond and fix this!! thanks."
138,Comments need to be viewable by phone,1,10/19/2021 8:32,"No one uses a computer these days. Why have you guys still not updated your app so that you can actually communicate better? I had messages that were 4 years older that I never knew about because you don’t show messages in the SoundCloud app. It’s 2021. Should be an easy fix for you. If you fixed that, I would give you 5 stars instead of 2. Love the fact that you promote unknown and small artists.

Worst app ever. Years later, not one shred of giving a crap about being able to use the message part of the app. Who listens to SoundCloud on a computer!? Lol

I can’t ever check my messages or reply. Also, you support child pedophelia and satanic worship with the artists and songs you promote aka Panda Eyes."
139,Just my opinion,5,12/7/2020 14:53,Like if we were able to post our song to a public page and not just our own that would be fire basically a sound cloud media where ppl can shear your songs tag ppl in the songs just in case your friend is on sound cloud y’all both have a song together you can tag him or tag ppl that should listen and ppl can rate your music you can pay sound cloud to promote your music Bc I’ll dead pay 50 just to get 1000 real listeners just rate my song and share it
140,1st app review ever,5,2/10/2020 11:33,"First and foremost, SoundCloud is an amazing app and I’ve been using it for a few years now. It’s gives new, talented artists a legitimate chance to shine. I really don’t have too much to complain about. But developers could you incorporate some type of button or way to unlike all the songs simultaneously. I know it’s not really a feature that is asked of often, but there are people out there that would love the ability like I would. Regardless I’m still giving the app 5 stars, because music is life and the app helps me through it."
141,Mehhh....,4,11/18/2020 13:16,"I do t really understand the point of ads. Especially if for most apps ,your goal is to get people to be on the app as long as possible, ads would not really do a good job at that. In all honesty, it makes me want to throw my phone down the drain just to skip an ad. They are pointless and draw less attention toward what you opened up the app for in the first place. I would maybe replace it with something that showcases Music that individual listens to on the daily such as artists and tunes they are already accustomed to hearing. It just seems to make more sense that way."
142,It’s incredible,5,9/14/2020 5:44,"I love it. It’s great! Has all the music I love! I can listen to music all the time, it’s very convenient. I was so thrilled when I found out u can listen to music even when you’re using another app! I listen to music when I’m writing in google docs. It makes work time a lot less boring, everything is better with music. Amazing app. Ads are annoying but expected, it’s free. And the ads aren’t terrible either. It’s only like one every 5-12 songs. It’s wonderful. I can recommend it enough."
143,Greedy SoundCloud,1,4/13/2021 13:43,"Nickel and Dime you for everything, some songs you can’t listen to without SoundCloud go (despite me paying the highest pro subscription already), the GUI is horrible to use especially for creators, worst of all they treat your profile view as one big playlist instead of “top tracks, liked tracks, reposted tracks” all being seen as separate playlists (which they are). So if you play the first song in your top tracks, it’ll play the first three “top tracks” then the first three “all songs” then the first three “reposts” then “liked tracks” etc. which is really bad design because it’s completely counterintuitive and now takes waaayy to many submenus just to get to all the music I literally pay SoundCloud to host."
144,It’s God’s but there’s a major issue right now,3,7/16/2020 16:42,"I love SoundCloud, I love how I can just listen to it whenever. Sure the ads can get a bit annoying from time to time, and have to pay for Go is a bit stupid, but I’m fine with it. However, after I got this new update, any song that I search up and try to play has a Verizon ad that can be skipped. Ok not a problem, but whenever I skip it or wait it out the song starts for 1 second and kicks me out of the app.

SoundCloud team, I know you don’t listen to us, but please fix this. I need you to. I can listen to my playlists just fine, but if I want any new songs I can’t look them up, and it’s stupid. Fix it"
145,Suggestion?,5,4/21/2021 23:05,"I love this app when it comes to listening to music, but I kinda wish that it had a better system of not listening to a certain thing, For example, I want to just listen to music, but than a podcast pops up, than the app assumes I love these podcasts and plays more and more of them, when in reality I just want to listen to music. So I just suggest having a system where you can just listen to a certain, either its music, podcasts, sleep noises, etc.

Thanks for reading this!"
146,update,2,7/16/2022 21:13,soundcloud had the same look for years until recently when it got an update. since then i’ve had many of issues with the app crashing.  as an avid user of this app for a long time this is a big issue for me. i can’t even make it through a small 4 song cd without having to restart the app MULTIPLE times.  i loved this app for the ability to continuously play music even after the cd with a similar sound it was THE best app for that since it has the biggest selection of underground artists. i’ve now stopped using this app because of this and i wish they wouldn’t have tried to fix something that wasn’t broken.
147,SoundCloud’s great but...,3,2/3/2020 15:08,"Please make ads skippable. The amount of ads you get are ridiculous sometimes. Why do I need a 30 second unskippable ad after EVERY song I listen to?? It’s unnecessary.

Sometimes the songs glitch and after listening to it and you get an ad, then the same song repeats itself, and then after you hear the song again, another ad comes and the cycle repeats. The only way to stop the weird glitch is to completely close the app.

I can understand why ads are in the free version of the app, but there’s no harm in giving an option to skip. A long time ago that option used to be there, it’d be nice if it came back."
148,Plz read this,4,7/11/2020 18:47,"So sound could is great and all but lately, I’ve been having to make new accounts just to listen to my favorite songs because I apparently reached a free “monthly listening limit” and after this, most of the tracks I previously listened to become previews and I have to get SoundCloud Go in order to get the full track. I just wanted to ask if you could change that because I am thinking of uploading soon and don’t want to constantly switch accounts knowing I will upload soon. It would be weird if I had all my songs but not on the same account."
149,Exclusive Feature?,4,1/31/2020 11:16,"The Google Play Store version seems to have a feature that the Apple version does not (the “up next” list). This feature was great when I had an LG phone, but now I really wish it was on Apple. The main purpose I would use it for is to listen to new songs I searched up while still having my playlist on shuffle. I would add a song to my “up next” and the shuffle wouldn’t reset. I could also see what songs are next in the shuffle queue. Please bring this feature to the Apple version, if possible. If not, I would at least like to know why. Thank you."
150,Love this platform,5,4/1/2022 8:50,"My two gripes. No track info for tapes. It would be nice to see titles for individual tracks that the artist posts without having to use a laptop or desktop. Also, never being able to see how many plays a track has if you pay for go. I wish there was a simpler way to indicate that you have a song downloaded without obscuring that info. The track info was a very early feature of this app that disappeared and never came back"
151,"New Look Is Clean, but….",4,6/16/2022 18:55,"Love SoundCloud. Always have, always will. Glad it finally got a much deserved and needed facelift.

 I have two simple issues that have gone on for years
       1) Why on earth does the navigation bar at the bottom right have a section that is literally an Advertisement to upgrade to SoundCloud Go+. You are using the nav bar as a advertisement and won’t let users edit the sections. That is beyond petty and unnecessary…I already pay $6 a month for SoundCloud Go, why are you giving me an app that feels like a free/lite version? It’s a bad look and a bit rude.

       2) No Chromecast or projecting to computers, Xbox, Smart TV apps? It’s 2022, I’m sick of having to use Bluetooth when I want to listen to SoundCloud and I have all these smart devices with their own SoundCloud apps? You should be able to use your phone to control the other device’s SoundCloud apps. 

Other than that, SoundCloud is truly goated."
152,A must have music app,5,8/26/2021 6:10,"Soundcloud is a great music app with good benefits and the right tools when it comes to putting your own music out there and even when it comes to promoting it as well! If your just into listening to music in general Its still offers a TON of your favorite artist’s songs and genre music you may be into. I recommend to anyone who doesn't have soundcloud already to get on bored with it! You’ll be happy that you did and can thank me later 😉😎👊 

                      -  MaC x BeatZ"
153,It dose the job,4,11/18/2021 23:45,"It isn’t as bad as people say it is, that’s for sure.
I’ve been misting songs on SoundCloud for about 3 years. I have exactly 300 songs as of the time I’m writing this. I have noticed that when I scroll through my latest songs it lags A LOT. The farther down I go the worse it gets. I only have this problem on my iPhone seven. My previous phone (Google Pixel 2) did not have this problem. This problem has accrued with lots of different iPhones. 
So that is the only thing I don’t like about this App and I hope that it gets fixed :)"
154,“Can’t upload song “,5,5/13/2021 22:10,"I was able to upload music last week. Now all of a sudden I can’t anymore. I upgraded to Pro unlimited to see if that would fix the problem and I still get this message when I try to upload from GarageBand. 
It says “Can’t upload song, review you account details and try again later “ 
It also says I need to confirm my email attached to my SoundCloud page. I send the message confirmation to my email. But it doesn’t pop up.  Need help NOW"
155,Tying up loose ends.,4,1/1/2021 22:35,"I think that the app is fine. I would like to suggest the implementation of auto-correct for comments. It is very jarring to go between multiple apps that have auto-correct, then to try and comment on SoundCloud, where its missing such a crucial feature. 
I would also like to suggest the implementation of SoundCloud messages coming to mobile. Everything else is mostly fine. I think that those two problems being fixed would add to the quality and utility of the mobile/IOS version of SoundCloud."
156,Update Locked and Froze my phone.,1,11/29/2021 7:13,"This update froze my iphone 7 plus. first, i couldn’t open soundcloud. i tried to open it and it would immediately close. so i checked the app store to see if it needed to update. sure enough, it said, “update”. so i pressed update, and then it glitched the f out. then, a pop up popped up, saying, “unable to install soundcloud”. i pressed ok and it kept popping up. i could press anything on my phone so i shut the screen off and turned it back on. The pop up was still there and i couldn’t put in my passcode on my lock screen or even swipe to turn off my phone. to fix this i had to go on my mac and contact apple support. i shouldn’t of had to fix it. it should’ve just updated."
157,No one to support you if anything goes wrong!,2,3/12/2021 1:25,"Not a single soul inhabits the support team of their Help Desk Department, nothing at all seems to be present or existing there. I am lead to believe that this is the space where the place called “Limbo” is truly located in the real world; if not, then they are identical in every single detail, indistinguishable from one another.  I still have a problem with my account and I would appreciate it if I could please get some form of resolution and then I will be able to resume my GO+ subscription access which has been cancelled until I can get the much needed support from SoundCloud’s help desk to fix the prevalent problem with my account!"
158,What is wrong with this app,2,8/8/2020 22:55,Ok I was scrolling through the App Store today and found this app so I got it and I was like it’s not bad it’s cool but I searched up some songs and this is when my mind went blank. When I heard the songs all of them were just recorded from a video and there was a tv playing the music and I could barely hear it I tried to search the it again but the same thing happened I suggest the people who made this app should not allow people to upload their own version of the song that you searched. Just put the normal songs on there and continue I’m not downloading this app again I’m deleting it and I know I’m deleting the app but just please fix this bug thank you.
159,Horrible mobile app,5,5/27/2020 21:47,"What’s so hard about making a mobile app for music. Such a big company with minimal effort into the app. The desktop version is fine, it works just fine like you’d expect. But the version on mobile is filled with lag and glitches. It’s slow and often crashes. Stop pretending like you’re doing something about it by making weekly updates that are really just updates for adding new ways to implement ads and promote big artists."
160,Interface update,2,6/15/2022 1:51,"While i’m aware that the newest interface update is matching the ios version of the app to the longtime other mobile versions I still just have to say it’s a massive downgrade. The massive icons and large clunky text feels basic and overcrowded. The menu change to jet black instead of grey like every other app negatively stands out. With massive song covers, long time and serious users are struggling, having to scroll with like three songs on a screen at a time. The biggest problem could be solved by shrinking song covers to the old size. Honestly as a long time user i feel like might be my tipping point onto another platform."
161,iOS 13,3,12/7/2020 18:47,Ok I wanna know why that was added because my phone deleted SoundCloud and I can’t download it back and I JUST paid for the subscription a couple of days ago and I can’t update my phone because I have no storage at all. now I’ve wasted my money if I can’t figure out a way to download the app again. I’ve had SoundCloud forever and I’ve loved it so just why it’s one of the best apps I have. And all my favorite songs ever are on there and I have a very bad memory so I’ll never get to listen to them again... So please SoundCloud let me have my app back man i don’t want to waste all that money for nothing.
162,Good app. Needs more features.,3,12/1/2020 10:24,"I love SoundCloud as its a great way for me to discover great music by small artists. It functions well and the UI is enticing and easy to use. My only issues with the app are the lack of ability to shuffle songs while already playing a song from a playlist, and the inability to view the description for a song in the app. There's also nowhere to provide feedback for the app. Adding support for CarPlay would also be very useful as I put on SoundCloud when I drive.
Overall I give it 3/5 Stars (Would do 3.5 if I could). Otherwise it's a great app for listening to music on the go."
163,Ashley Delilah Gamez and Daniel Francisco Guerrero are forever together for eternity.,5,1/29/2020 9:54,"Daniel first meet Ashley when she was 27 years old and he was 27 years. Both of them knew that they were meant to be. They loved each other like if there wasn’t going to be a tomorrow but always knew that A tomorrow is embodied for them both.
Now that they knew they had each other in this life, they always knew that they had each other in the afterlife. They always love to love and laugh.  They love how when they look into each other’s eyes they always felt the “static electricity”."
164,I loved SoundCloud until...,2,3/4/2020 16:30,"I’ve been on this app for 5 years now and Ian never had any issues on here until these past two months. Back in January you guys made all the music only available for SoundCloud Go+ members. Then made the music available again just to do literally the same thing this morning, I feel as if you are going to make the music for Go+ members only then you need to do that. Making the music available one minute and not available the next is aggravating and is making you guys loose members to other music apps. Cause after today I no longer have any interest on continuing with this app. I hope you guys soon fix the issue cause that’s inconsiderate."
165,Amazing but,4,7/8/2020 16:00,I love this app it has all the music I love plus I listen to when I’m playing gacha life whitchbus the best... I do have one complaint  and it’s about how many adds pop up I was listening to a DONT then a add piped up then offer the next song there as a another add them when I was going to tap on a another song on the app there as a another.i know it’s that you buy for no adds but really I really need to buy it that’s my only complaint but if your downloading it for the first time you can find almost all the songs you like on here so plz download it’s amazing ~ a big fan
166,SoundCloud rating,5,4/6/2020 17:54,"I started using SoundCloud not to while ago and I made playlist and loved it just today I was listening to my playlist and the songs were cutting short I looked and seen that all my songs in my playlist say “go” on it that I had to get go to have my songs back, I loved SoundCloud now not at all just because of that I’m hoping it’s just a glitch or a bug and maybe tomorrow it will be back to normal, giving it 5 stars for the time I used it but right now how I’m feeling about it is like a one star"
167,Good but...,3,3/20/2020 4:28,"I’ve used SoundCloud for a long time and I really like it. But recently I’ve been having a lot of problems with Go+. I haven’t gotten Go+ and I refuse to for this reason: half my playlist is suddenly Go+ but when my friend, who also doesn’t have Go+, looks up the songs, they’re free. Why would I pay to listen to songs that are free? 

I didn’t want the songs in my playlist since I couldn’t listen to them anymore so I unliked them/got rid of them. A few days later I looked up one of the songs and it was free again. I looked up all of them and they were all free again. This has happened to me 3 times now.

I’ve seen other reviews with people complaining that most of their music is suddenly Go+ but no one’s mentioned it being free for other people. 

My phone is updated, app is updated, I closed everything, I re-logged in, I deleted the app and re-downloaded it but it still isn’t working. 

I really like SoundCloud but I’m probably gonna stop using it if this keeps happening."
168,Was awesome,2,2/5/2020 5:24,"I used to love SoundCloud but they’ve been progressively making their subscriptions more expensive and making the free version less usable, every time I go to the app to try and switch a song it put up an add for go plus (this is super annoying while I’m driving), and like every 4 songs I have to sit through 60 second of probably some of the most obnoxious and annoying ads there are (not to mention it’s the same ads over and over) this app just isn’t worth it anymore from a listeners point of view, and I could go on for days as to why it’s not worth it from a creator point of view but I don’t feel like typing an essay while I have one due in a week for English"
169,Thank you Jesus for saving my soul,5,12/5/2021 1:08,"This app is great. I believe you already know but just in case, Jesus Christ is the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, He is way, the truth and the Life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Repent and trust in Him alone for salvation for WE have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Please know I do forgive you and will pray for you and always know that I need Jesus more than anyone on the planet, hope to see you in heaven one day because of His death on the cross and resurrection giving us forgiveness of sin and eternal life"
170,"Good, have some glitches though",4,3/5/2022 19:19,"Recently upgraded SoundCloud premium for the DJ support. I like the amount of tracks, and community remixes are cool too. But when I was customizing my playlist, the next day I open my mobile SC app and it had duplicated all my playlists! I have a lot of playlists so this is really annoying to scroll through bunch of duplicates. I don't want to delete them because I don't want it to accidentally delete the original too. Not sure what to do. This is clearly a glitch. Hopefully can be fixed soon. Thank you"
171,I love this app but not when it does this !!!,5,1/11/2021 0:48,"I put heart and dedication into my account and I don't deserve what I’m getting in return,I legit just logged out of my account just to log into my 2nd account to check on my normal one just to see if everything I did to my account would show if someone clicked my profile and it will not log me back in no matter what I do I’m super mad I’m going out of my way to get wifi in the cold just for it to still not work could you help me 😡?"
172,Recent songs button not working,4,12/3/2020 13:16,"Hi guys tbh this app is litterally the greatest app I’d used for the past 2 years and I have never used a different one. But right now there’s something happening with the recent songs button or recent albums, when I press them it dosent work and neither the recent albums button. I mostly listen to my songs there because is easier. And now I have to listen to my stuff in liked songs. Is not really a big deal but if someone could fix it it would be greatful. Please and thank you"
173,TOO MANY ADS,3,6/13/2020 16:50,"I been using SoundCloud for about 4 years now, and up until recently I never had any problems. I can find different versions of popular songs, and listen to newer, lesser known artists. I never had a problem with ads on this platform but MY GOD I can’t get through 2-3 songs without getting ads, and what’s even worse is that they make some ads (that just so happen to be the longer ones) unskippable. Considering not many are paying for SoundCloud go that would remove ads, this has to stop. I am sick and tired of being interrupted with an Old Spice ad while I’m vibing to my music. Please fix this SoundCloud"
174,Trying to upload my song,4,4/30/2020 12:58,"This app is AMAZING, I give it 5 stars! But there’s either something wrong with the app for something wrong with my phone. So yesterday and right now I was trying to upload the songs that I made, but when ever it’s done processing I refresh my page and the whole app, my song just disappears. I have been trying to figure out if I didn’t anything wrong, and I didn’t do anything wrong. I think this is a bug, I hope this app gets updated really soon, this is the best song I’ve made this year so far!"
175,Sound cloud is taking my music to Go plus,3,2/23/2020 4:27,Sound cloud is my favorite music listening app and it annoys me when the songs I’ve been listening to every day go on (GO PLUS) and I can’t listen to it anymore this has happened before and I stoped useing SoundCloud came back like a week later the go plus went away now it’s back and half my playlist won’t play I would rather watch 20 ads a day and still get to listen to my music than have to worry about my favorite songs going on go plus and the owners of sound cloud make money from ads so what’s the difference please stop ruining my vibe music really gets me through the day
176,Increase in previews,3,6/18/2020 16:27,"I’ve had SoundCloud for almost 3 years and I loved it. Throughout the 3 years, I’ve liked over 1,500 songs, and very few were the previews (30 seconds) The most recent update though has me frustrated. More than 1,000 songs I’ve liked have been turned into previews now. I can’t listen to a complete song without it ending after 30 seconds. It’s quite annoying. I’m guessing it’s because SoundCloud wants us to buy the premium or upgrade for full songs by the original creator. I would’ve gave 5 stars if it wasn’t for the new update because I could listen to music for hours without any ads."
177,Pretty good!,5,12/8/2020 9:16,"I’ve been a SoundCloud user since 2015, and for what it is, it’s really good. 
For starters, I’m on the free version, and I don’t get that many ads, yes, sometimes I do get 2 ads, but it’s not really that irritating. 
You’re able to like your songs and listen to them over and over without being forced to pay to listen to a specific song, or go on the hour free like pandora to listen to your favorites. 
I would say more but honestly I’m just tired and I’m too lazy."
178,The amount of ads are ridiculous,2,6/13/2022 21:31,"Are used to love SoundCloud, in fact I have a bunch of old nostalgic music from when I used to listen to when I was younger. I get on this app to listen to music not on the main stream apps. The thing is I struggle to use the app longer than five minutes because every two songs you play, the app pauses to run an ad and it is incredibly annoying! God forbid you have he app open when it’s time for an ad… then you cannot leave the app without the ad pausing and you can’t even lock your phone or the ad will pause. Uninstalling due to the stupid ads, I just want to listen to music…"
179,PROS AND CONS,3,11/17/2021 13:30,"People post a lot of good stuff on here. Unreleased songs from your fav artists, some artist post their albums on here for free without need for the sound cloud premium version. However the thing that upsets me the most and why i’m deducting 2 stars from the rating is you can’t loop a playlist! They want you to listen to their recommended songs SOO bad. as soon as a playlist ends it goes straight to their recommended. i’ve tried to loop it. doesn’t work. the loop symbol with a 1 on it only loops a song that you are currently listening to once before continuing on to the rest of the playlist. SMH fix this."
180,Great app,5,12/1/2020 18:30,Out of any app for using music so far this is the best you don’t need to pay a dime just to listen to a good song in the background like most other apps they have you pay like 15 bucks just so you can listen to anything in the background and that’s what makes this the best app for listening to music and even it gets annoying when you have to pay for something you can use for free in this app I love this app so much you recommend 10/10
181,Inspirational and refreshing,5,3/26/2021 12:33,Skye Jethani’s daily Devotional has been an amazing addition to my life. I love how convenient it is to be able to listen to it while I do other things.  It is so deep and inspirational even though it’s short and sweet. I have enjoyed being able to go back and listen to previous devotionals. His ones on the Saints has been amazing;  I have learned so much and I’ve been encouraged greatly in my faith. I wish everyone would take the time to listen to him daily.
182,Got some issues,4,1/16/2022 21:39,great app for music that isn’t mainstream or songs you cant find on other platforms. HOWEVER SoundCloud y’all need to fix this issue with liking songs but then they won’t add to your likes or when you unlike songs but then they don’t get removed from your likes. most irritating thing in the world because now i have songs that disappear and won’t remember the names of them and it mess with my whole playlist. this my only problem but it irritates me the most. please fix this.
183,obviously great but…,4,4/11/2021 23:27,"SoundCloud has been amazing for countless reasons. The mobile app has also come such a long way. However, what is going on with the shuffle algorithm for likes on the mobile player??? I feel like I hear the same tracks over and over again and half of them are super old tracks I’ve liked in 2016. When I listen on my PC, the algorithm plays a good balance of more recent music and older music, as it should be on mobile. 

Hope this gets attention. 

Much love to the devs. Y’all revived this app."
184,Soundcloud Go+ and Suggestions!,5,9/5/2020 16:44,"I have had soundcloud go+ for a few years now, and it’s absolutely worth it! Soundcloud, unlike other platforms has plenty of music from artists that aren’t available on other streaming apps. 
However I’d really love it if there was a option to repeat a playlist/album! This option is featured on the desktop version (I think) and it would be a really nice feature to add onto the app because I want to keep listening to Ctrl on repeat. Love the app overall!!!"
185,Need to able to search songs in Playlists,4,9/28/2020 2:35,"Glad you guys finally added an up next, but you guys really need a way to search songs in a playlist cause sometimes we save a song in a playlist so that we have specific version saved somewhere. The thing is I have a playlist with over 300 songs and it would be so much easier to have a search bar instead of scrolling through every song or looking it up and having to find the perfect version you want."
186,A good app to have.  But admittedly better alternatives.,4,5/29/2020 6:07,"I’ve been using soundcloud for several years and I’ve enjoyed its features, a lot of diverse song and all the features were functioning great.  However I am quite annoying that when I want to listen to a song that reaches a lot of success, you must buy a premium to listen to the real thing.  And I am also a fan to listening to podcast but they do not post on SoundCloud.  But non the less I enjoyed every bit of this app and I will continue to use it.  Thank you for helping me shape my taste of music."
187,Permanent Damage: Battery Charge Increase,1,1/23/2022 14:41,"I’ve downloaded this app on the iPhone 5, 6,  8, and 12 spanning from 2016 today (2022). Despite actively putting my phone in airplane, power save mode, and low brightness to conserve energy, using this app for an hour not only drains your battery quickly but shortens it’s life rapidly. Long term use for a month+ will dramatically increase your charging time for your phone. 

Solution: All users should be able to “download” songs by a wifi source so they can play them without phone or internet connection on the go. Also, the screen should be able to go in “dark mode” to further reduce energy consumption phone uses to produce light on screen."
188,Go plus glitch,1,3/13/2020 18:52,I’ve used this app for years and loved almost every day but today when I went to search for all the new albums coming out I was surprised to see that for some reason ALL of Lil Uzi Verts music was put in Go+ and I was only able to view the previews. I was quite annoyed that he would block the free users but when I went to go look up another artist ALL of their music was blocked. This happened with EVERYONE. I went on to my computer to see if it was the same and I was able to find everything and it wasn’t on go+. I’ve tried to contact anybody over at SoundCloud and they are reluctant to help me. I am very disappointed at this resolvable problem. Would not recommend
189,downloaded songs,5,10/28/2020 16:40,"I have Soundcloud Go+ and I have been using it for almost a year now and I enjoy being able to listen to my downloaded songs anywhere but in the space where you can normally see how many streams a song has, “Downloaded” appears in its place. I personally like to see how many streams a song has and just putting the green downloaded icon next to or in front of the amount of streams would be easy."
190,Editing options (playlist title),4,2/28/2022 19:36,"I love, & use SoundCloud everyday. I also have premium subscription. I make a lot of specified playlists, & it’s always really frustrating when I can’t go back & change the titles after I’ve created a long playlist. I also change my mind a lot lol. So having the option to change the title if I need to would be really nice. Instead of just hanging to crap the whole the things & start over.. Plus other platforms I use allow you to change titles anytime"
191,Explore page glitch,4,4/14/2021 14:34,Love SoundCloud but it’s been glitched or something for months I can’t refresh my explore page it’s just stuck on a loading screen with 5 artists I listen to frequently displayed in a row. I’m not sure why it’s like this but it shows the little loading circle at the top of the screen aswell. If u can fix this it would be greatly appreciated that is one of the ways people find new music through the app and it’s literally been 3-4 months that this has been happening
192,amazing except one thing.,4,12/1/2020 23:23,"i’ve been using this app for YEARS and i love it so much. everything is great, the drop notifications, the music, everything. but the only problem is soundcloud go. i don’t think that people should have to pay to listen to a certain song. i feel as if i shouldn’t have to pay 13 dollars to listen to a song. i was trying to listen to hello by pop smoke, and it told me i needed a soundcloud go subscription to listen. which i don’t feel as if it is very fair. but i do love the app🖤"
193,Garbage,4,9/17/2020 19:24,This app is absolutely garbage I had it for about a week and then I opened it and it wanted me to sign in again for no reason so I do that. When I finish it says that they have an account with that email and to create one so I do that I use the same email and password and they say that that already have an account with that email and that I need to sign in so I go and do that but same thing that I said above happened and I repeated the proscess about 3 time and it never worked other than that great app
194,"Great app, but ONE problem.",4,1/23/2020 23:37,"Okay. I've had SoundCloud for 4 years. I've relied on it for music. But I have a little problem. I lost a lot of lied tracks, and I wanted to find them again by going through my listening history, but it's so short. I suggest extending the listening history because some people wanna find their old unliked tracks to bring back and sometimes they don't remember the name but remember the cover. I beg you please to maybe add a feature that allows people to look at ALL of their tracks that they listened for the past few years."
195,Amazing! But...,5,7/30/2020 20:51,"I love SoundCloud! You can listen to music without even paying for it...well, most of the songs need GO/GO+, and to remove ads as well. That’s why this review is here. Not because of the subscription in general, though, like other reviews. I just have an idea where artists - and you, consumers included - can benefit without GO.
        Donations/fundraisers! I know that ads and your subscription help you earn money, however if you have an idea, you can just make a fundraiser. (Editing later.)"
196,Why No Descriptions?,4,8/5/2021 15:07,"Love the soundcloud app for its unique interface & being able to play in the background, but how come the mobile app doesn’t allow you to read track descriptions and tags? Seems like a key feature from mobile that’s ultimately cutting out part of the artist’s platform to give background information or external links. I usually enjoy the Upload playlist created by Soundcloud but it would be so much easier to explore a musical thread if tags were exposed on mobile."
197,Amazing App But..,2,11/22/2020 23:26,"This app would be amazing if I could edit my email. I joined SoundCloud a while back but deleted the app because I didn’t have enough storage. A couple of months later I got the app again and wanted to produce type beat tracks. So, when I tried to edit my profile and produce a track, it said to have my email verified and that the verification would be in my mail. I looked in my mail but it wasn’t there. I was thinking that this was probably an old email of mine that I logged into, but, I didn’t use that email. So, I tired to find my email on SoundCloud and try to change it/look at it but I couldn’t."
198,mUsiC,5,7/13/2020 15:40,"I love the app and the way it is but there are problems, People keep wanting to promote themselves People ask if they want n*des And soundcloud keeps lagging and not having offline music if you have soundcloud GO and soundcloud GO+. can you fix all of this please? I mean i have no problem right now but can you fix it? Could you also add a lyrics button like pandora and Apple music like they have a section where they find lyrics. But can you fix all of these problems"
199,Excellent new source of new untapped quality music,5,12/9/2020 6:13,"Well done highly interactive individual input and social capabilities with a fairly functional and user-friendly layout, with quality sound with a multitude of variety music to select from over all have been impressed I’ve tried almost all other music apps and and definitely within top 3  no doubt well done.. keep up the good work and look for to the future. 

Thanks, Mike"
200,My honest thoughts,4,7/18/2022 22:20,"I’ve used SoundCloud for over 7 years now, I love it, very aesthetically pleasing music app to use and I have hundreds of songs saved that are “SoundCloud exclusive” I also pay 12$ a month for the go+ pass, I’ve noticed that the servers are always in a rutz , it seems like of all apps SoundCloud is the only one I will ever have small issues with. As of now I can listen to songs but cannot open any artists profiles, I’ve restarted my phone and reinstalled the app and still no fix."
201,Omg that was legitness,5,6/25/2020 7:43,They gave me a free year of SoundCloud plus for just answering one question and rating the app I really recommend using sound cloud over any other app because SoundCloud has the best music and sound quality. There are some downsides about the app though. If you want to listen to a song and it has a plus sign next to it you can only preview the song if you don’t have SoundCloud plus. So I recommend getting the sound cloud plus to get all of the music that you want.
202,Very convenient with all genres and features for everyone to enjoy,5,2/14/2021 17:35,It is a very great app that I have been using for about 2 years and I am very satisfied with the services this app offers. SoundCloud is very supportive of their artists and has little ads. Those ads funds go to the artists. And if ads aren’t your cup of tea then you can get premium for a low monthly cost. My personal favorite audio streaming app. Highly recommended. 5/5 stars always.
203,"Great app, but........",4,7/15/2020 11:51,"I love SoundCloud, don’t get me wrong. However, there is one thing I have to say. I don’t think that we should have to pay for SoundCloud Go+ just to listen to songs by specific artists, it doesn’t effect me too much, as I listen to electronic music (got hooked on it from playing geometry dash), but sometimes I want to listen to actual songs (I love  to listen to Eminem’s songs, I don’t mean that in a weird way) , but I have to pay for most of them. That is the only thing I have to complain about."
204,My pets love it,5,8/15/2021 8:36,"Very good app for playing music in my ears! It’s always sounding great and my dog just loves to listen to some tunes. Great fun for the whole family as we listen to songs together weekly, it’s almost become a tradition for us and the cats just love every bit of it. I recommend this app to anyone with back pain because it has helped me extremely and I feel so sturdy and firm but not tight; it’s a great balance and my dog loves to go on walks now that I can actually stand up."
205,i use this app every single day but i have a complaint,4,6/13/2022 13:57,"I cant go anywhere over an hour without music, i listen to music 24/7 and that’s not an overstatement. i love the app so much i use it more than any other app on my phone. i’d ball my eyes out if something happened to the app and it was gone but ever sense the most recent update it is very buggy. my main concern is that the search isn’t working. when i look up songs that i already have on my playlist to test it it says no result."
206,to be honest folks ...,5,1/15/2020 8:04,"This app SoundCloud is very good and passionate about streaming music , that different platforms didn’t even hit yet . There’s a lot of good - jamming - music and even artists have a chance to blow up there career not just as “ SoundCloud Rappers “ but to “ Artists “ in the Music Industry. SoundCloud has a additional “ SoundCloud Go+ “ which is a great opportunity to listen to your music offline . The price is decent and affordable to all . In my opinion this app is a great choice for music playing and stuff . Have a nice day 🤍!"
207,User friendly,4,1/30/2021 13:00,"I have been using sound cloud for a long time on daily basis. So smooth and easy to use that I could not get used to other apps so far.  
The only thing that bothers me is that, after using it for a while, you find yourself in a loop of songs similar to your likes which it seems to keep you from new experiences. 
Searching is not smooth and brings lots of results that takes a lot of time to find what you were looking for. 
But still, I am a daily user"
208,Randomly skips songs,3,1/26/2021 1:14,"I’ve used this app for a long time and I never had any issues other than a slight lag when scrolling through a long playlist. However, I’ve recently been having an issue where the app skips past 2 or more songs any time a song ends. This happens regardless of whether I’m on shuffle play or not, and it’s gotten to be very annoying. I’m not sure whether this was an intentional change to the app but I can’t say I’m enjoying it. It’s kind of been ruining my experience with the app, so I hope it can be fixed soon.."
209,ITS FREE!,5,7/21/2020 1:19,I really like this app it’s so much better than Apple Music because it’s free and it’s surprising that Apple Music makes you pay to listen to music?! But while I sit here listening to sound cloud but sadly there’s adds but it’s usually at the end of the video. There’s tuns of music to listen to as well. This app was really unexpected to see but it makes me very happy! I honestly don’t think anything is really wrong with this app I really injoy it they have very good graphics with out this app I wouldn’t be jamming!
210,Money-hungry,1,7/2/2021 12:09,"It truly is unfortunate. Soundcloud used to always be my go-to option, and I put many friends on Soundcloud. With the new update, however, premium is now required to even listen to music. When they first introduced advertisements, I did not mind, as it was a good way to keep it free. Seeing as how they now require you to own Premium to listen to the tracks that are in your history, I will be uninstalling and telling all of my friends to switch. I'm sure my feedback won't really matter, seeing as how this is a massive company, but it feels good to get it off. Maybe you guys revert this update, in which case I will return to Soundcloud. Truly, what a shame."
211,I love this app but,4,12/10/2020 0:50,"So I’ve been using this app for around 4 years I’ve always loved it. But the ads are literally so annoying now. I’ll listen to two songs and get two 30 second ads right after.  It’s just way too much, I understand you can pay to be ad free but cmon are you serious? I don’t need this many ads when I’ve only listened to two songs. Sometimes when I barely open the app and choose a song I get an ad when I haven’t even played anything, it’s annoying."
212,App keeps getting worse with every update,1,9/23/2020 20:57,"Everybody else who gave it a one star rating complained about ads which, when you’re using a FREE music platform ads are something you should get used to. Your favorite artists needs these ads to make money and survive. My problem is once you hit 10K liked tracks on SoundCloud, which I’ve accumulated 30K in 4 years the app stops working. Songs stop playing, the app crashes constantly, ads crash the app constantly, liking or commenting crashes an app, and when I click on a song it keeps the old cover art and title from the song I was just listening to so I can’t like, repost, or comment on any new songs."
213,"Not bad, but a little buggy.",3,4/13/2020 4:38,"Overall not bad.  The iPad app is buggy. There’s no mechanism for reporting bugs either, you have to complain in the App Store or wade through support and submit a form about something unrelated to bugs.

For example, the timeline has two views: Collapsed and expanded. If you open the app and (as I usually do) expand the timeline first to play the current song (which is saved in the app), the timeline will get stuck at zero or if you scroll around it’ll always stay stuck at that time stamp (even if the music plays).

Finally: Please, the iPhone app really should support Apple CarPlay!"
214,"Amazing, just one thing",5,8/27/2020 6:48,"God i love this app. I am an instagram editor and I use audios on here all the time. I also make my own audios. I would really appreciate it if you could add an option to post on soundcloud from your phone, because I’ve tried to post on the computer and it’s a little tricky. But adding the option to post from your phone would be absolutely a life saver. If you are unable to activate this feature, I completely understand. Thank you for reading:)"
215,UNDO BUTTON?!,2,6/7/2022 14:29,"I’m sure by now I’m one of the many people who have brought up how frustrating it is and can be to (accidentally) delete a song from your playlist and not know which one was deleted or have any way to get it back. You can spend all this time, effort, or money on the app and STILL lose your hard work *just* like that because you have no way to see any accidental deletions or any way to undo an action. It would be great if at least THAT was a new option in the one of the many updates. Nothing seems to be new about the app except “bug fixes”- but this could be a REAL FIX!"
216,Description,4,1/15/2022 22:44,"Great app! I love listening to music that most other streaming platforms dont have. One complaint though, the lack of a description button. I recently switched to iphone and i signed in to my SoundCloud account, but i noticed i wasnt able to check the descriptions of songs. I think this would be a very useful feature. Rn the only way to check descriptions is to open a web browser and check the description there. It would be very helpful if added!"
217,"App works, but lacks functionality",2,7/10/2020 13:30,"After all these years, I can’t believe SoundCloud for iOS still doesn’t have a queue/play next function. Browsing, your library setup... what’s considered a playlist in general is also clunky. There needs to be a way to look at your custom playlists separately from artist/other user’s playlists (aka albums? Also, why is there no albums category?) You should also be able to click on a song to view its info in search without playing the song. You basically can’t search or browse music while you’re listening to something... not that there’s a queue you could add it to anyway."
218,I post all my music and sound recording that I want share with the world on SoundCloud,5,10/17/2021 18:24,"Although my music is sometimes odd and most often different from mainstream music scene,  I still want listeners.  SoundCloud sounds really good to me and their mastering facility works great and makes everything sound so much better.  There is so much great stuff from so many artists you can listen forever and never run out great recordings to immerse yourself in!"
219,More features,3,1/31/2022 4:58,"SoundCloud could use more features. Adding the ability to play songs from the platform straight to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram with no issues. I know there may be red tape but if that’s the case, then why be able to link the song’s page to Stories but not be able to play the songs? Also, add a built in add-in plug to be able to control the decibels and such. Similar or exactly like an Equalizer system board. 3 stars for moderate crashing that the app does and lack of interactive features."
220,Love but... 🥺,5,3/3/2020 2:12,"I use Soundcloud everyday and absolutely love it more than all the other music apps, but can you guys please have some kind of undo button? Sometimes, I accidentally unlike a track and when I re-like the track, it goes all the way to the top and I have tracks somewhat in a particular order... as in I know where to scroll to find it. I know there's a search bar, but an undo button or even ""are you sure"" caution message would be amazing 🥺👉👈"
221,Love soundcloud but why are simple things hard to ask for?,3,6/2/2021 22:23,I would like to give 5 stars but i feel liek there are some simple things lacking. A simple button the brings you to your profile page would be nice. I feel like the insights tends to gain one thing and lose another. Im having trouble figuring out how to see my total plays for a given time period as well as a myriad of other insight features that are straight up missing. Also being able to edit in more detail the tracks that are posted such as description
222,After recent update,2,7/17/2020 5:02,"I’ve had this app for a while and I do say it is a very good app. It has an plethora amount of songs that people can listen too. Whether it’s a new artist or a mainstream one. However, after this update all songs are unplayable. You have to buy the subscription in order to listen to songs that I’ve already heard weeks ago. They need to fix this unless this was their intention. If it was then this app has dramatically gone down their standards. I might delete the entirely if this isn’t addressed. I would rate a 5 before this happened and now a 2 because no songs are available without paying for SoundCloud+"
223,Switching songs on playlists!,4,7/25/2021 6:32,"Everything is good, love everything barely any bugs or mistakes in songs and, but it’s just that when you want to switch the order of songs in your playlist but you can’t, so like is it okay if you can like add the ability to switch the order of songs (like dragging the song to any place that you like the playlist) on a playlist?? If that makes sense, sry I’m good at explaining... but thank you, I use this app all the time and I’m loving it ❤️🥰"
224,Great app but go+ is ridiculous,4,4/8/2021 20:46,"I’ve been using the app for around three years and it has been doing well the ui is great and it is super easy to navigate, but a lot of the songs I enjoy are locked to go+ for some ungodly reason. It was alright since it let me download songs and used to be10$ which was on the more expensive side but it was fine. Then recently for some reason they changed it to 15$ which is ridiculous, too much for a couple extra songs imo."
225,"SoundCloud is a cool music app?  Umm... No, SoundCloud is the BEST!",5,4/6/2021 16:56,"I heard of this app 5 years ago when my friend Vadim from Sacramento CA came back from visiting our motherland(Ukraine). He was introduced to SoundCloud by his cousin who is a DJ of a well known radio station and a hot nightclub in Kiev.  I loved it since the day I heard about you.  The whole platform is cool.  Good job SoundCloud team,  keep doing what you have been doing ladies & gentlemen. Stay safe & healthy.  Thank you.  God bless you.  Listening in Seattle/Tacoma WA United States."
226,New Update is awful,3,6/12/2022 7:03,"As the title states this new update is horrendous. Ive been an avid sc supporter for years but this latest update has me so aggravated. I can no longer add songs to my playlists, it just automatically makes me try to create an entire new playlist when i try to add a song to any of my old ones. I can also no longer clear my “recently” played” or “listening history” sections. The app just overall doesn’t feel like it should.. Please fix these bugs or go back to the latest version, thx :/"
227,CarPlay?,4,8/11/2021 18:38,"SoundCloud has always been my go to for listening to DJ sets and unreleased music. I always recommend to everyone with similar music taste as me.

But can we please get a CarPlay app already? It’s been around for years now and it doesn’t make much sense that we don’t have one yet especially with every other music app having one. It’s impossible to use the SoundCloud free when driving in the car, and it would be nice to like songs and view playlists on my car’s display."
228,This is a great app,5,4/30/2020 17:24,"The reason I'm here is bc I never had a problem since I downloaded it long time ago until today each time I open my SoundCloud it crashes that never happened to my phone it's 3am I try to hear some music but it crashes I rest my phone and try unstalling the app and download it again it crash again please work on this I have more that 1,000 song on here also I think it's time for another update so please do that thank u"
229,Souncloud Rate,5,1/6/2020 4:00,"I would definitely recommend this app to people who hate listening to music and then your phone turns off because you’re away. Well, SoundCloud is different... it has a millions of song to chose from that you can listen to and even make a playlist to add them on, and listen to your music while you are doing other stuff. I give this app 5 stars. Whenever school is over, i pull out my phone and go on SoundCloud. Good Job SoundCloud employees!"
230,Good,5,6/12/2021 13:43,I’ve been using SoundCloud for about a year now and it’s been fine but I want to make the cover art of tracks different based on the album I’m putting on. For example I have a EP with cover art for some of the songs. But I wants to add those song to a album I’m working on with the new albums cover art. Plz let us change the cover art of our songs based on which album or playlist it’s on
231,Too many updates,4,9/3/2022 18:53,I love this app I’ve been using it for almost 3 years now. Though the weekly updates are really becoming an issue. I always have to figure out the new way to edit a playlist every week and it’s really getting annoying. I wish they kept the previous format of the app because now there’s way less features that maybe they forgot to add or just don’t even bother. Also too many ads. Other than that it’s a good app.
232,A recent issue with playing music,4,6/14/2022 15:05,"This app is great and I’ve used it a lot but from yesterday there’s an issue that SoundCloud won’t play any of my songs, even with internet and connection, it’s just goes to the next song with the same issue and saying “loading error”. I tried deleting and redownloading and that didn’t seem to help and I think it’s a major bug preventing me from even doing the main purpose of it,I’d appreciate if you could fix it."
233,Soundcloud could be a classic,3,5/6/2022 5:18,"But social media integration is unreliable ie. Sharing to instagram stories via audio snippets. 
I've asked, read forums, mailed them, nothing no concise answer or support. Which just isn't good enough and doesn't inspire confidence. 
Creators need to be supported in order to contribute to the platform if we aren't given the tools and support to there's only so far a platform can go to. 
Sound cloud has done so much for artists but looking to the future they will have to at least lock down the basics in order to stay relevant."
234,"Love the music, but I have a bug",4,5/27/2021 19:55,"This is a really good app for whenever you want it listen to free music, but for the past year I’ve found a bug on my iPad that won’t fix itself no matter how many times I update the app. What the bug does is that it randomly skips songs or stops in the middle of one for no reason at all. At first I thought it was my headphones, but when I got a new pair it kept happening. I was hoping that you could fix this bug. Thanks for the help ☺️"
235,So basically,3,3/26/2021 19:21,"Basically if you aren’t trying to listen to unreleased music, just less ads than Pandora and Choice of song, that is of course if SoundCloud doesn’t decide to delete the songs you listen to. When Unreleased songs release after an artist has died, usually they releases it and artist or not, someone’s the unreleased “illegal” version is better. So SoundCloud. At the end of the day you’re sub par, I’d be better of ACTUALLY pirating songs onto like a USB stick. You’ll never get my money because $12 is absolutely absurd you freaking money hungry HUMANs.."
236,Great until..,3,7/16/2020 8:09,"when i first got the app it was great. It had all the music i was looking for, all playlist, songs, even track stations you can listen too. One day i open the app and all my liked tracks and the playlist i made had turned into previews only. I thought it was a one day glitch thing but it’s been like that for about 3 weeks ,and now i can not listen to music. All songs are 30 seconds so there’s basically nothing to listen too. I hope it can return back to normal with the full songs and ads."
237,Free version is great,5,11/16/2020 17:42,"Most of the tracks I listen to are long mixes (1-2 hours. SoundCloud only plays ads every three or so tracks you listen to, regardless of length, and never interrupts a track with an ad. I’m also constantly discovering new content that I never would’ve otherwise. I’ve thought about paying for it but it’s kinda expensive and I’m fine with a coupla ads every three hours or so."
238,The ups and downs.,4,2/27/2021 20:55,"Alright so over all I give this a 9/10 rating. But there are problems that happen, such as my music will randomly stop out of no where. (Which is pretty weird but never bothered me)
But also when you follow some one such as a music artist it sometimes doesn’t show up at the top like it should. But overall I give this app a pretty good rating. (It’s the only music app that I can tolerate. All of the other ones are like a fever dream, I don’t know where to go.)"
239,I love this app but I went one thing from you SoundCloud,5,10/22/2020 4:39,SoundCloud can you change a liked tracks because every time I have to move one of my favorite music or songs clicking a like button when a glitches the like button don’t work I have to waited 3 or 4 days Could you please make a move up and down just holding a favorite music up and down so you can placed it on favorites spots .
240,Bugs,4,6/18/2022 1:44,"Love the app but I found 2 new bugs after a 2 updates ago where it crashed the app when you put a playlist on unless you skip the next song than it doesn’t crash. The other bug is when searching for something to listen to the app freezes your screen and won’t let you play the song you had just searched, but even after that it crashes again 10 seconds into the song."
241,It’s great but there’s one problem,4,7/27/2021 7:17,I love SoundCloud I’ve been using it for along time but my only problem is that when I repay for my subscription it says that the songs that are for go plus are not available in this area ANS they where right before it ran out. I’ve tried updating restarting my phone and eveything but it says the same. Please help me with this problem I would like to return and listen to my favorite songs while subscribed to go+.
242,Great music for FREE !,4,2/21/2021 16:14,Not necessary to purchase music when you have SoundCloud! You can get all the music you need and want fingertips I need a little time in the love of music do you have a wide variety for everyone I highly recommend you do this and listen to Soundcloud me and my little ones love listening to it and my husband loves it too I’m gonna recommend he gets it on his phone soon😁🥰😊💖❤️💙💜 we just love it !  Thank you for helping out a family w no means to have music 🎼 🎵 🎶
243,PLEASE LISTEN!,2,8/19/2020 20:52,"Would be nice if you guys added the “your tracks” or “my tracks” menu on the library page, replace the following option with the “my tracks” It’s kind of annoying having to click my profile then having scroll down to the latest track menu. Also would be nice to arrange playlists hate that it goes from new to old in the order you created it. ALSO fix the issue where you can’t listen to your downloaded songs because you don’t have signal defeats the purpose of paying for this feature and not having access to it when you have minimum cell reception."
244,ADS ARE INSANE,2,7/30/2020 16:47,Been using sound cloud for years and this morning I deleted the app. I usually close out the app and re open when ever a ad pops up. This did not work today. Every song I chose I had to listen to an ad first. Even if I closed the app. So basically couldn’t listen to a song without first hearing an ad. Some ads don’t even let you leave the app! I use sound cloud because I can leave the app and still listen to music. But lately the ads are taking over. Pointless ads too. Stuff I will never buy or care about. I refuse to purchase GO because the only thing you get out of it is no ads. Super disrespectful
245,I usually love SoundCloud,3,8/2/2022 17:16,"I’ve been using it for years but there seems to be a crashing glitch where randomly SoundCloud will crash. I have to physically reopen the app and once I do, the app restarts whatever song I was listening to back to the start. This is mainly frustrating for if I have the music connected to my car , as having the app I’m using for music crash while I’m driving makes it annoyingly difficult to open the app back up again without parking.
Bedsides that I enjoy the music."
246,The best of the best but….,4,5/14/2022 19:00,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for years now. I have to say it’s the only music application I use. I can’t even be bothered to install another one. This is perfect and it’s the best! 
However … for the past 2 years you’ve removed a very important feature such as the time when the music was uploaded by the artists. It was very important for us users to make the difference between older sets and new releases! Please bring this feature back!!"
247,A mediocre artist experience,3,5/10/2021 11:23,"I’m a pretty small scale artist but it truly is a slap in the face to have my page get mostly bot interaction and for SoundCloud to give a typical PR-saving response when I ask them. There is no way to really see track details like the description, and there is no way for me to edit a track-specific banner on the app. 
This isn’t a 1-star rating because this app does what is required. Like the bare minimum was met. But that’s kind of it. It’s glitchy in places but it still uploads and plays music, so… congrats on doing a job."
248,Really great app but..,4,3/21/2020 19:00,"This is all around a really great app but I have a  reoccurring problem where when I open SoundCloud it will make it where every song made by a popular artist is only available for SoundCloud go plus members, even tho I was just listening to the same songs not to long ago. And I get frustrated. But when I go to the website version of SoundCloud all the songs are available for me to listen to. This happens for a solid week then stops then happens again. Please help."
249,Problem,5,7/21/2022 2:12,"So I was able to stream music while being able to play any game on roblox, but yesterday (or on Monday.) it stopped working, and normally it would always cut off whenever I join a game, which was normal, all I had to do was turn it back on, now it turns off completely and u can’t turn it back on. So I was just wondering if u had anything to do with Roblox or you guy’s update? Please help."
250,All of my playlists are gone,2,9/2/2022 1:09,I’ve been using sound cloud for I think about 4 years and it is a decent music player. But when I logged into my account and went to some of my playlists to listen to some music. Come to find out the song in my playlist are not in the order I left them and are now entirely random with even less songs on the playlist. And sometimes when I reload a playlist I would get no songs on the playlist as well. I don’t know what to do or how to fix it but I’m not picking up this app until the issue is fixed
251,Perfect ✨💜🥺,5,3/10/2022 23:45,"So i got this a few weeks ago bc there were too many ads and couldn’t skip enough on my other music apps
I automatically fell in LOVE with this, you can skip and listen to any song on repeat, i am obsessed snd its amazing bc i can see comments of how other people feel abt the song!even on some sad songs you can see that ur not the only person going through things 💜"
252,App keeps shutting off,3,6/25/2022 21:32,"I love using SoundCloud and have for years now. This started happening a month or so ago but the app will randomly shut off without any rhyme or reason. Using the iPhone 13. Please help! I have the latest updates for the app and for my phone. Not sure why this is happening but it’s frustrating and happens at least once a day. The first time I open the app for that day, it always turns off after a certain amount of time then doesn’t do it again until the next day."
253,Log in issue,5,10/10/2020 19:38,"I see no problem on you guys end but on my part is where I messed up, I recently lost a sincere account of mine because the email linked to that account is no longer active and non recoverable, but I wish you guys would add a way to sign into an account while being able to use the usernames as well to sign into accounts, that would bypass the need of the old emails.."
254,Won’t let you delete songs from playlist that have been removed,1,12/17/2021 0:04,"Soundcloud removes a ton of music from the app because of copyright, which makes sense. The issue is that all of these songs are still showing in my playlists, and my “likes”, and anytime I unlike or remove the song it doesn’t work - it adds it to the top of the list again. 

Anytime I land on one of these removed songs, it also stops my soundcloud completely so I have to open the app and manually change to a new song. I have tried “reporting” the songs that are bugged, but it won’t let me send a report! Please fix this soundcloud 😞"
255,"Great platform, low quality app",3,6/8/2020 5:37,"I love SoundCloud.  I’ve always used the platform, mostly on desktop but as far as the app is concerned, it’s very limited with its functionality especially if you’re a creator.  No way to access messages on mobile, counterintuitive navigation, profile viewing, etc.. I could keep going but the point is there are a lot of things that are a hassle or just straight up not doable on the app.  I’m sorry but it would just make things way nicer if they made it more like the desktop version in terms of functionality."
256,I gave it 5 stars so people will see my review,5,8/3/2022 12:28,Algorithm is garbage if you don’t  Your music doesn’t get produced on for people to hear people won’t actually listen there’s no real listeners on this app people just sit there and they’ll like your stuff just for you to follow them and like their stuff back it’s a scheme to me to get money because you have to pay for your tracks to be heard and that ain’t right
257,Great app! Except...,5,9/3/2021 20:08,SoundCloud is always my go to app when I want to listen to music mostly because of the mass options of edit audios which I like a lot but there's only one small little problem and it's that it skips songs a lit in my playlists and it's kinda annoying. I would really like it if you didn't need a subscription to download songs but that's all I have to complain about.
258,Nice i guess but why? 😼😿,4,6/14/2022 9:55,"Well, the app wouldn’t even work after the update. But the next day, it started working again, which is great! I can only play my songs with no wifi. So I can’t do things on my phone that require wifi when I’m listening to music. I’m so confused why it won’t work with wifi. And it’s not my wifi thats the problem cuz I was using other peoples wifi yesterday and it still didn’t work. I need a freakin explanation. 😐"
259,Great way to share music but some bugs,4,1/7/2022 19:54,I’ve been uploading music and using SoundCloud for about a year now and I’ve always noticed that there’s been a bug surround the ability to accurately see who all has viewed each individual song. Like it’ll glitch and have less views than what’s really being let on. Cause when I view my songs the number of views will glitch from a higher value to a lower value. So ig something to look into.
260,Playlists are an issue,4,12/28/2021 1:39,"Ok so I love love loveeeee SoundCloud, it lets me listen to edit audios, different versions of songs, seriously whatever I want. But organizing the playlists I make can become a hassle. Y’all should get a merge playlist feature and the ability to order ur playlists, like put them in the order from most liked to least. Something like YT maybe? That’s my only complaint really! Love the app and would definitely recommend it :)"
261,Great except one thing (iPhone only),5,2/14/2021 23:42,"Everything about this is great: quality audio, few ads, and unlimited skipping/choosing a song. Only issue is that on IOS devices there is no way to have playlists repeat when they finish playing, so if I'm riding my bike or something I have to stop and restart my playlist every hour or so. Other than that, the app is perfect the way it is."
262,The app just deleted my data.,3,7/3/2021 20:44,"I used to be a very happy customer, that is until now. For the last couple of months the app wouldn’t work unless I decided get the latest IPod update, which I purposely decline because updates just make your device worse. This made it so I’d had to delete and re download the app except in a older version. I did this for a few months but today it just deleted all of my info. I didn’t do this before. What the heck SoundCloud!?!? Just lost a loyal customer because of that :("
263,I don’t trust them,2,12/31/2020 14:56,"I’ve used SoundCloud for all my music needs for about 2 years now. Recently I went to sign into my account and noticed it was gone. All my music, gone. They deleted my account! I went on Reddit a looked around to see if other people had the same problem, about 300+ people did. SoundCloud thought my account was a bot account!  I emailed the company and got a response back. Eventually they reset my account and warned me if I did wrong again they will permanently delete my account. (But I didn’t do anything wrong?) in conclusion be ready if this happens to you."
264,Sound cloud I blasting great original tunes,5,8/4/2020 23:01,"Love sound cloud not just because my Disk Dungeon podcast is here, but the player doesn’t have to be open to listen! That’s a huge plus! Hats off to the developers, I also love seeing the placement of where the song is it’s much better then just a bar. Such a cool feature, also like the balance of the famous and the up and coming. So many apps bury new guys making it that much harder to get out there!"
265,Great app but i have only one issue,5,6/11/2022 19:19,Literally my favorite music app to use and is so much better than any other but the new appearance of the app is ruinging it for me! I miss the old straight lines and how it looked before! And each song takes up more space on my screen now so i cant pick and choose a good one out of like 8 on my screen anymore literally the dumbest thing on soundcloud ever.
266,Please bring back swipe to delete,2,6/19/2022 20:07,"I am constantly adding and removing songs from playlists. Having the ‘swipe to remove’ made this possible, and was one of the reasons for paying for a subscription. Without that, the app is pretty useless. Yes, I know I can tap the three dots and select ‘remove from playlist’, but that is annoyingly cumbersome for the quantity of songs I end up removing.

Update: there’s a bug that causes the ‘currently playing song’ in a playlist to not update. Quite annoying trying to figure out where in the playlist you are at."
267,Latest UI update is great,5,12/9/2021 6:55,I love the decision to update the UI and everything looks so much nicer. The bigger pictures and button style are just so great. The only other feature I’d really want is the ability to see the description portion of a track. Sometimes I listen to mixes and I have to check the desktop app to read the description to see which songs are in the mix.
268,New Bug?,4,5/23/2022 17:30,so i have been using soundcloud for about 3 years now and i love it. i had about a hundred liked songs. then today i was gonna start listening to my music for my workout and i checked my liked music. it was oddly empty. so i refresh the app and try again. still empty. so i thought it signed me out so i checked and i wasn’t signed out. i had so many songs and they all somehow vanished. i hope it’s just a bug and it can be fixed.
269,Love SoundCloud,5,2/28/2021 5:52,"I love this app, been using it since I was in my preteens. Now I’m making my own music & uploading to it. Very easy & everything. Just I don’t like the fact when I’m going through songs I like there’s a limit to it. Meaning I can only like so many songs before it stops. Than I have to wait days & days to like songs again. Idk if that makes sense? But other than that, I enjoy it🙃"
270,This is perfect but if one single issue,5,6/16/2020 0:09,Ok so when I look up songs and I click on a track I listen to it normally but when it finishes it plays a recommended track instead of the track below it and it is pretty annoying so please give us an option to turn it off I just want to listen to all the tracks listed on the search section with just that song I put in the search bar
271,Glitchy and app needs more features,2,10/1/2020 9:19,"I encounter a lot of glitches on the app but one that bugs me is when I follow someone but on the artist page the follow button doesn’t say following, the system knows I’m following it just doesn’t show it.

Also you need to implement a group chat feature within SoundCloud that would allow users to join user created groups and join multiple chat rooms dedicated to sharing music And of course add a direct message option For both mobile and computers..

And fixxxx the feed ffs, make it more social and organizational"
272,Pretty good but...,4,5/31/2020 17:35,"The app is pretty good, I enjoy using it to listen to those in my community. i’m in an undertale au ost community and all the songs sound good. however, there are two flaws. the length of ads id unbearable, especially considering most 30 second ads make me wait 15 seconds to skip or not skip at all. Second, there’s a glitch where when i like and repost something on a computer, the app doesn’t think I did, even though it shows I reposted and liked it on my profile. So yeah."
273,All the sudden songs are SoundCloud Go??,2,3/17/2020 6:15,"This app is great. It functions well, it has a variety of music, and I rarely have problems with it. However, some songs that I have had for a while all the sudden were made so that you have to get 
SoundCloud Go to listen to them. I personally don’t have the money to spend on getting SoundCloud Go. I also find it very unreasonable that songs that I have found that specifically don’t need SoundCloud Go all the sudden need it. Honestly I don’t know if this is a glitch, but I will most likely delete this app. It was fun while it lasted."
274,I don’t understand…,5,6/15/2022 18:07,It keeps changing the interface the next time I open the app. Before I close it it’s the old interface then next time I open it it’s this janky squared interface until I delete the app and download again. It’s been happening more now so… I don’t understand because it goes back to the original interface when re download the app. OG interface.
275,Missing songs from playlist???,3,8/26/2022 4:54,I go on SoundCloud 3 days ago listening to a certain song. I go back on today to hear it and it’s gone from my playlist. I then realize many more songs were missing??? Remind you I’ve had SoundCloud since 2016 with the same playlists over 150 songs. I hope i get my songs back and it was just a glitch. Also the app keeps freezing/crashing and I have to keep refreshing the app. Please put my songs back in my playlists thanks!
276,Zero Stars,1,8/17/2022 12:40,"This app doesn’t work. I was told this by a member of the SoundCloud Team exactly this, “Our engineers are aware of this issue and are currently working on optimising the app for users with larger collections. The improvements might take a while unfortunately as we need to invest a lot into this. This issue is only affecting users with large collections (e.g. likes) or following a very large amount of users.” For an application that I pay monthly for, this simply doesn’t make sense. Stop charging users for features you cannot deliver. (

I have unliked and unfollowed a ton of users and this has done nothing to help the operating issues."
277,Love it,5,3/13/2022 15:02,I personally love music it’s how I express my emotions being able to listen to music and go into my own world is amazing SoundCloud let’s me do that and find all my unreleased Juice wrld songs and more not only that but if u ever end up in a situation where u do not have service the last multiple songs you listen to when you did have service will still be playable with no service
278,Good app but has a new issue,4,6/9/2022 20:05,"This app is very amazing, the music on the app is top notch and it’s cool how anyone can release their own music on it, but one new issue came up for me. The updated UI, for me it takes u much more of the screen and ends up making it harder to have more music available on screen at once making you have to scroll more if you have lots of likes, this however is my personal opinion and may not align with others."
279,Great but one thing,5,12/4/2021 22:02,"This app is amazing! I can listen to all my favorite songs and there’s only a narrow selection of what is needed for SoundCloud premium. I only ask one thing however hoping that the app people see this. When playing a playlist you made, there should be a shuffle so I’m not just listening to the same songs in a row every time. Beside that I LOVE this app. Best app to listen to music"
280,Shuffle,5,6/18/2021 16:52,I love this app so much. I’m able to listen to all my favorite artists; but I can’t put my playlists on shuffle. Idk if this is an issue with anyone else but my playlists don’t have a shuffle option. It would be nice to have since I have several artists and songs on one playlist and would like to listen to all of them without listening to the whole playlist.
281,Always had been,5,3/12/2021 0:55,"The most OG app to stream and share music with. They have changed the game.  Much of the functionality has changed over the years and it is disappointing that we can no longer share and download with one another as we used to.  That is the past. Now, it remains the sole app I use to listen to quality commercial free EDM mixes from across the globe.  Thank you SoundCloud"
282,Great songs and great opportunities,5,12/29/2020 5:49,"If you are trying to start in music, this app is a fantastic way to do so. Very clean and simple and I couldn’t love this app more than I already do. Endless opportunities for a starting artist. And endless choices of songs and remixes and playlists on this amazing app. And no, I’m not one of those bots that give apps a great rating to just sell the app. But I’m an actual person who really enjoys SoundCloud."
283,Good I just need some help.,5,4/2/2020 16:40,"I love SoundCloud but it stopped working one day so I tried reinstalling it. After I did that I tried logging in but it wouldn’t let me. I even tried making a new account. It let me sign in on my computer but not on my phone. Could you see if you could possibly resolve this problem? I have also reinstalled the app multiple times, so I don’t think it is an issue on m end. Have a great day and stay safe!"
284,Amazing but...,4,10/31/2020 5:38,"I love this app but I would like some things to be different.

1. Every time you listen to a song and it ends you get an ad, this is extremely annoying because I love Corpse Husbands music but they’re short so I have to listen to an ad every 2-3 minutes.

2. I hate that it’s so hard to find the original of a song, when I search up songs I’ll get different kinds or types of the song and it’s extremely annoying."
285,Eh...,3,8/24/2020 14:56,"I love SoundCloud and I have been using it for years but a few issues have come up. For example, when my AirPods are connected my music will continue playing but there will be mo sound through my AirPods. Or the sound will glitch terribly in the middle of my song. I know it's not my AirPods or phone because this is the only app I have that problem with.
Also, I occasionally get logged out of my account out of nowhere which is really inconvenient. Or the app will shut down and not re-open and then I have to restart my phone and stuff."
286,Very good but not giving only four stars because I’m a music lover just one issue,5,6/20/2022 20:25,"So uh just gonna keep this short so yeah. Every now and then, I try to like songs and I hit the heart button, and it adds it for a second then removes it. It’s very annoying please fix this, or it might just be a case of I need to check if it needs to update and I’m complaining about this for no reason."
287,Great to listen to but has some AD issues.,4,6/29/2022 14:06,"I am very happy with the service of SoundCloud and the array of songs are superb. However, there are some issues with advertisement options. I don’t know if other people have the same issue, but everytime and everyday that I use SoundCloud…I would always get a Reese’s AD. This has been happening for months of the same ad company everyday. I’ve found myself to dislike Reese’s because of this."
288,DM’s should be on the app by now lowkey,5,6/3/2022 16:47,"I love this app and use it everyday, I am an very small artist and use my phone a lot more for soundcloud than the website and thought it should be easier to reach out to other artists than to have to hop on the computer every time to send a DM or receive one. Not mad at all, just think it would be dope to see such a simple feature added to the app!"
289,Neat soundz,5,7/21/2021 14:19,"I I have been listening to music since I was 10, and I just turned 59 the other day. I love music almost more than I love life because to me music is life and it changes everything around me. So I was very pleasantly surprised when I was introduced to SoundCloud and I continue to be impressed and get great enjoyment out of Just laying back and let the tunes flow through my head. Thank you and have a great day"
290,Good App For Music,4,8/15/2021 20:46,"Altogether SoundCloud is a good app for music, I have Go+ so I have access to a little more than some. Overall it has its bugs and little issues, but the only big thing that had bugged me is the uploading of homemade remixes is kind of tricky due to copyright issues. SoundCloud should allow users to upload their own remixes and remakes of songs. I’m not educated in copyright and whatnot but I don’t see how letting someone upload a great homemade remix will hurt anyone."
291,"It’s amazing, but one small problem",5,2/21/2021 23:19,"SoundCloud is very good, but the only problem is there are ads, but that’s ok, because everything has ads, well mostly everything, that’s why I’m not taking away a star just because of ads, but yeah, SoundCloud even works without internet, you just need to have the song in your playlist, so SoundCloud is great, I love it and use it everyday"
292,Old sound vs new cloud,5,5/17/2020 9:41,"Cant say ive had any issues. 10 years ago to todays cloud based technology. A weird moment in between coming of age kinda thing but no crash no bugs no bullish...
Except for Otto the support bot... AI is an assumption based logic.... its a human job... its just one annoying step and waiting period to solve a simple problem. Thats all computing is, problem, solution.
You got a problem lets solve it pick up the mic while the dj revolves it. 
Go ninja Go ninja Go ninja Go!!
Nailed it!"
293,SoundCloud fix your update,1,1/5/2021 15:16,"I hate that my music that I like or put in an album is always disappearing like it takes time for me to find good music and it's really annoying to have to find and sometimes I can't even find it, also you guys did a bad job at the new update , you added way more ads, I can’t play one single song without an ad, on top of that , when an ad is playing and I get out of the app the ad pauses until I come back and stay there to watch the ad, like that is just so dumb, I’m not gonna sit there and watch an ad when I have an important text to deal with. Please get that fixed , thanks"
294,Doesn’t work well on iOS,2,10/10/2020 23:21,"I love that SoundCloud is kind of independent from the other streaming services and offers a great place for niche stuff, but I really wish the app wasn’t such trash. I’ve consistently had issues with using the basic music controls on iOS with this app, over multiple different versions, which is pretty disappointing considering this is a music app. You’d think they’d at least get that right. Right now I can’t even cast to a speaker and use the music controls in control center, I have to literally go in the app and pause it. Trash."
295,Beautiful,5,2/6/2022 23:37,"The best music streaming and discovery platform I’ve ever had the joy of experiencing. Their algorithms seem to understand what you’re looking for and adapt to your changing tastes over time. As someone who listens to various underground electronic genres, I find it remarkably easy to “stay underground”, as I am never bombarded with the “latest hits” but instead more of the types of artists and sounds I truly appreciate. Deep thanks!"
296,Glitch,3,5/4/2020 19:27,"There’s a problem with the app. I’ll be listening to music from my own liked songs and then it’ll play one song and the app will exit itself. Like it cuts off at the end of the song and then the app refreshes itself and brings me back to the middle of the song. I just updated it in the hope it would stop but it hasn’t. I can’t even listen to more than two songs without this happening. Also wayyy too many ads, again can’t even get through two songs without an ad or 2."
297,Performance issues,2,7/23/2022 14:59,"This has been my app for listening to music for almost 10 years now, have thousands of songs in my liked library but I have noticed that ever since the last few updates the performance on the app has gone extremely down hill. Constant crashing and the app freezing mid song and now I cant even open the app without getting stuck on a loading screen. Please fix the issues this is not a regular problem and it is making it hard to use the app at all."
298,Awesome app just one thing,5,11/22/2020 6:10,I love using SoundCloud when I wanna listen to music on here without having to go on other platforms. Now something I need to address I’ve noticed whenever I’m listening to music in my library or on the home page it keeps crashing or before I can listen to the music it will lag then crash so I was hoping if that could be fixed.
299,Paid subscription/like button,2,8/26/2021 10:11,So I bought the 6 dollar subscription for SoundCloud and everything was awesome until i noticed the like button started acting weird. Sometimes I had to tap 6 times for it to save to my library. When I was downloading music and adding it to my liked tracks everything would save fine until I got to my 115th track which DOESN’T save ANY tracks after that if I close the tab. This is very annoying especially after I heard the limit for cheaper pro is 1000 songs please fix this
300,Stability issues,2,1/18/2021 4:42,"The app frequently crashes whenever I turn off my iPad. It’s like I’m forced to keep my device on and in the app in order for it to work. On top of that, it just started skipping my songs for absolutely no reason. As soon as one song finishes, it will play the first second of the next song before skipping two or three songs ahead. Even scrolling through my liked songs page is difficult. It lags constantly whenever I scroll up or down and when I type in the “search songs” box."
301,Too many adds,4,12/7/2020 8:02,"I like how it’s free but I’m constantly getting adds almost every other song. Most of the adds u can’t skip that are over 30 seconds long, getting 2 at the same time u can’t skip. Especially the video adds u have to actually watch it, can’t turn off your phone can’t do anything, once u run off your phone the add pauses i like the app but it’s just the adds that make it horrible."
302,It needs to be fix,4,10/29/2020 19:21,When ever I try to type something it’s very laggy and when I scroll through my playlist it freezes all the time. Also yesterday when my new playlist came up for this week it was pulling up my last week playlist for some reason and keep say reconnect to your WiFi and i knew that it wasn’t my WiFi and it kept doing the same thing over and over again yesterday
303,SoundCloud is Amazing,5,7/31/2020 14:57,So I gave this app 5 stars because music has always been important to me also I got to grow up in a era where some of the greatest modern artist first started making songs one SoundCloud for all to hear SoundCloud is the best app for finding songs that you want however this is a user based upload so you will have to pay for officials released music by artist other than that the app is 10/10
304,Great but some problems,2,8/9/2020 22:43,"First of this app is great for listening to music on the way to school for a road trip etc. you can choose almost any song and it’s available then there’s some that aren’t which is fine, but the adds why?? There’s so many adds like is it even that’s serious to have an add every 2 songs. The other thing is there’s some inappropriate ppl on here with bad pictures like this is a app for music not that kind of stuff bc when you see that it just ruins the app ion even wanna go on here no more but for the music it’s great just not the adds or the other stuff. Thank youuu"
305,a fantastic app,5,1/23/2020 6:46,"I wish I knew this app earlier, I discovered so much new awesome music through it. It needs some improvements though: e.g ability to rename playlists, ability to change order of songs in a playlist, ability to search other user's playlists for a specific artist (currently seems to work only if the entire playlist is named after the keyword you're searching for). Great app anyways."
306,one error,4,7/20/2020 11:58,i love soundcloud and i’ve always recommended it to people because you had so much availability without having soundcloud go and it was ok because some songs were go every now and then and that was fine because they were songs i could go without but recently like two weeks ago i opened my app and my whole entire playlist was soundcloud go and i thought that’s weird and that’s just a bug so i got the soundcloud go free trial and when it ended today and all my tracks were still go i got kinda mad so i don’t know if y’all did this on purpose or if it’s a glitch but if you did that on purpose i should give you a 1 star rating and delete this app but if it’s a glitch can you please fix it i’ve loved soundcloud for so long and this is the only time i’ve ever had an error
307,Need ability to view and edit queue (next up),5,6/15/2022 20:28,Love this app. Use it religiously. I would like there to be a way to view the songs that are next up (like on the desktop version) as well as being able to shift the order of songs. At the very least make it so when I add a song to “next up” it puts it at the end not the beginning of the queue.
308,"Amazing app, just one problem",5,4/11/2021 2:25,"Honestly, I use SoundCloud pretty often. I’m new to using the Mobile version however, as I usually use the Desktop version. There’s been an issue recently where sometimes if you save a song to your library, it refuses to save. Over all this is a beautiful music app for producers and users alike, but I just had to bring this issue up."
309,"Good but, why is there no add to queue?",4,1/30/2022 20:16,Soundcloud is my favorite platform for streaming but i’d like to be able to build a playist on spot for the moment. There is Add TO Next Up but then you have to wait and add another next up. Let’s just add to queue so we can keep the song selections playing instead of always having to open the phone back up when our next up song plays so we can finally add another to up next.
310,"Really good app, but minor bug",4,3/17/2021 22:17,"I’m a mobile soundcloud user and I noticed that there’s this bug, where some playlists that soundcloud generates for me, shows the wrong image compared to the picture on the first song in the playlist. It’s not bothering me that much, but It is confusing to see a new picture on the soundcloud weekly or “the upload” playlists, but still have the same songs from its last update."
311,Awesome App - Just One Issue,4,6/8/2020 10:35,The app design is absolutely great. Finding new music is also really easy too. Having a music timeline to find new music is helpful. The only issue I have with the app is. On my iPhone 11 Pro Max. In dark mode when you search for an artist or song. There is no or at least hidden text in the search field. It’s just a minor inconvenience and all. You just have to be careful what you exactly type when searching. So you don’t make a mistake in text at all.
312,The worst ads out of any app,1,1/5/2020 19:42,"I’ll be listening to music with the first song on my likes playing, when all of the sudden after ONE song I have to listen to 2 different 30 second ads! And if I bare down and listen to this un-skippable minute of ads, after one or two more songs, I have to listen to another minute! It’s unbearable! Especially for running, biking, or working out. It’s disgusting how half of my time listening feels like ads. And if I’m mid way through a song and want to pick a different one, you guessed it, another minute of ads. Get your act together SoundCloud. You used to be my favorite, now I’m using Apple Music for a lot cheaper"
313,Best Music App Ever! Just the Comment Spams,5,4/16/2021 4:25,"SoundCloud is perfect for youth and adults to post their music. I personally love this app. It’s just, the spams in the comment section are inappropriate. It says the app is suited for ages 12+... but 12 year olds don’t need to see these comments about female body parts. That’s the only downside this app has. If y’all can fix that, then it’s certainly suited for kids 12+. Again, it’s an awesome app to post music."
314,Doesn’t work after Update,4,6/13/2022 16:19,"i’ve updated soundcloud recently, and no matter what it doesn’t play anything. Turn off wifi, using data, nothing. It’s managed to play ad’s just fine but otherwise it hasn’t worked since. I’ve used this app for awhile, and it was amazing before it started to just stop working after being updated. If it’s forcing me to buy soundcloud go to work? I’m not interested."
315,New Glitch?,4,1/16/2020 4:07,"If I’m being honest I use SoundCloud about 6 hours a day, and I’ve been using it for a fair few years. But something I noticed recently was that I can’t see the number of plays/likes a song has. Not really that big of an issue but it still bothers me as sometimes I think something hasn’t loaded properly, or that it might be playing the wrong song etc. If this is just a new feature then don’t acknowledge this complaint. Thank you."
316,It’s Good But Not Accurate,4,7/29/2022 17:44,I would go to sleep at a certain time when I know that I’ve been sleeping more. Because I would set a timer on my phone to see how long a sleep and at the same time I would set this app up when I sleep when it would say that I’ve only been asleep for four hours yet the timer on my phone would say I’ve been asleep for eight. Not accurate at all when it comes to tracking sleeping habits.
317,"Please prioritize ""Recently played"" ahead of ""Related tracks""!!!",4,7/10/2022 20:06,"I use Soundcloud exclusively as my choice of music platform and I LOVED the ""More of what you like""/ ""Suggested Tracks""/whatever it's called carousel-- whichever one that recommended more tracks based on frequently played songs. This new update moves this carousel WAY further down the  homepage and pushes ""Recently played"" way higher. It makes it harder to find other tracks recommended for me. Obnoxious!"
318,Laggy On Mobile,4,3/9/2021 3:06,"Its honestly an amazing app, I can listen to all kinds of music and even upload my own freely. My only problem is how laggy it is on my tablet. It takes me about 2 minutes just to click off of somebody's profile after browsing the tracks they've posted because of how slow it scrolls(due to lag) and how late it responds to me clicking on the arrows. Otherwise its a great app I'd definitely recommend"
319,Each update adds more bugs!,2,1/27/2022 2:44,"My stream is frozen on an error page. Or a page of artists to follow, who I don't want to follow. The app has suddenly unfollowed dozens of artists I've been following for years and won't let me re-follow them. This used to be a great app. The last three updates have made a perfectly functioning app a very non-functioning app. I've found so many non-mainstream artists here that I have never heard of before. I really liked this app until this year. This makes me very, very, sad. (completely updated ios on iPhone SE)"
320,Probs with Download Functionality,1,3/9/2021 20:18,I’ve encountered almost a dozen instances when music I’ve previously downloaded turns out to be unavailable. I get an error message saying space isn't available but I can see there’s an abundance of space available! I’ve noticed this tends to happen when I enter a new country which is very bad timing since traveling is when I want to access my music the most but finding a strong wifi connection required to redownload everything all over again can be scarce. I hope you solve this problem because it’s a real disappointment each time it reoccurs!
321,Great..but,4,12/5/2020 19:10,"I had a SoundCloud account before but I had to restart my phone. I forgot the password to it so I made a new account. I tried to verify my email and clicked on the link but it still says I need to verify my email, which is so DUMB. Please fix they verification to where when you click the email, your account is verified..now I can’t edit my profile and I’m stuck with some dumb profile picture and dumb name. Very nice app though."
322,Loop playlist,4,10/10/2020 6:45,"I really like sound cloud a lot, the ads my get a bit annoying from time to time but that’s ok. The think I have a problem about is on my iPhone I can’t seem to find out how to loop the playlists I’m listening to. I used to be able to before when I had a Samsung and I can as well on my pc but for some reason I can’t seem to find out how to do so on my iPhone. I would really like some help on figuring out how to do so."
323,Ads,4,9/23/2020 21:01,"Ads are a really big problem for me, I get 2 30 second ads after every 2 songs and sometimes in the middle of a song and yes, I know that I can pay for premium to get rid of ads but the price is to much for me since all I want is to remove ads and you guys (& Apple) get money from watching the ads anyways, can’t even skip the ads so every ad I get(at least 20 an hour), you get payed for it anyways."
324,SoundCloud issues,4,9/21/2020 22:49,I love the app so much. The only issue I have is that SoundCloud sometimes just buffers and lags when I’m scrolling down playlists or just trying to find a new song to play. It lags and takes forever and has a delay out of no where sometimes. Then when I press play on a song sometimes it doesn’t play for like 10 seconds and it just has a huge delay. Other then that great app👍
325,No Support Whatsoever,1,8/21/2020 20:24,"If you use this platform as an artist you are 100% on your own.  This company offers no support at all.  They are so unwilling to help that there’s no option to get help located anywhere.  

They have FAQs that are completely useless - they ask was it helpful at the bottom and you can see every question has less than 20% who think it was helpful.  What an absolute joke this company is.  

Honestly I’m tired of these companies that completely ignore their users.  It’s a great way to end up out of business which is all I hope for this company due to the anger and frustration they’ve caused."
326,Take it Back,2,5/17/2020 15:22,"SoundCloud recently updated their system to make it where a majority of their music is now only included in buying the full version of this app, this will greatly hurt the apps functionality in the long run.  My favorite about SoundCloud was I was about to listen to hit songs along with underground tracks from upcoming artists now I will no longer use the app and a lot of other people won’t either and that will extremely damage their underground system which Is a big part of their advertising."
327,Recently,2,1/22/2020 0:32,"Starting to get ver annoyed w/ the app.  freezing then crashing. Been listening to it everyday for years, but recently the app. has been crashing a lot. Also, why isn’t the app & the website synced better? I was switch from listening on my iphone to my mac & the selection I was listening to in the phone is missing on my computer. This happens often. Can’t enjoy an app if there are starting the be constant issues! And now for the last couple of days everytime I try and go into playlist it freezes then crashes. I’m about give up."
328,Unavailable Songs,2,1/3/2020 19:47,"I’m getting real tired of songs that I have liked showing up later as “unavailable in your country”! What makes it even more frustrating is when I can go to the artists profile, search for the song and typically end up being able to play some songs. I mainly like this service for the fact that you can “like” as many songs as you want. With songs constantly showing up “unavailable in your country”, it makes liking songs feel like a waste of time and therefore the service not worthy of my subscription fee!"
329,Updated review,5,9/1/2022 19:30,"Previous review I had given was in relation to the search bar feature being removed/bugged. It seems to have been rolled back to previous functionality which has made me incredibly happy. The app is great and has so many good quality of life features, on top of having a great selection of songs. Once more a happy go+ user"
330,Update your IOS app better,5,7/1/2021 17:12,"Hi, loyal SoundCloud listener here since it became an app. I can’t add songs to most of my playlists on my phone, only two of the newest ones I made. Also the insights page is sweet, but it shows no data on there at all even with one day of data:/ I love SoundCloud but some of your tech needs better updates to actually fix problems. Peace and love, out!"
331,Crashing all the time (the update),1,6/28/2022 18:50,"I’ve been using this app for a few years and have always been satisfied with it (apart from 2 un-skippable ads playing after every song lately). But recently, since the new updates, it has been crashing during nearly every song if I try to play one and leave the app. It’s very frustrating and ruins the mood when I’m using my phone as a music playlist for my family or friends. It’s especially annoying in the car when I have to take time and attention away from driving to fix it. Very disappointed in the update."
332,issue?,3,6/13/2022 14:38,Ok let me explain. I deleted the app and reinstalled soundcloud and when I go back in I click a random profile pic and I don’t see the playlist or music I closed the app and got I to SoundCloud but nothing happens I did it a few more times and I still have my account there and available but i did delete the app all the way I signed in to my account and nothing happened I don’t know if it’s the new update or it’s just a bug or a glitch but can u please fix this issue.
333,Premium doesn’t make it any less glitchy,2,10/20/2021 1:53,"I thought by subscribing to Go+ a few months ago would make the mobile SoundCloud experience better. You STILL can’t see the information or the post date on the app. You STILL have a ton of problems making and downloading playlists. You STILL have a terrible search algorithm and can never find anything you actually want without intense searching. Overall, I just wish this dev team would put more time into this app because there’s so much great content on here."
334,Soundcloud review,5,6/11/2021 18:53,Very convenient and there are very few songs that you can’t listen to the adds are short also. Very easy to use all you have to do is search up a artist or song and there albums will pop up if you look up artist. And almost any song you can imagine will pop up when you search it up.
335,Good and bad,4,1/18/2020 17:09,"I’ve used SoundCloud for years and I love it. Has tons of music, a variety of artists and unreleased music. Sometimes they put double ads which are irritating- nobody wants to wait a minute to listen to a song and then have to wait again after the song for another ad. It would be nice to have shorter ads so it doesn’t interrupt the music too much, but I understand why it’s needed. There’s no point in paying when I can get Apple Music for less"
336,"Amazing, but weird when phone is closed",4,3/31/2022 13:35,"I have been using this app since 2015, and never stopped using it since. This app is one of a kind, although it kicks me out. When I turn my phone off, it kicks me out about 2-3 minutes later. When I have my phone on, it’ll last about 25-45 minutes. Don’t know what is going on if it’s the app itself, or just my phone. Please try and fix if it’s the app"
337,Ads are becoming very often,3,8/15/2021 15:53,"I’ve had SoundCloud for 5+ years and have used it and still use it very often. When I first got the app ads were shorter and usually you could skip them. Then they took away the option to skip them, no problem. But not it seems like I’m getting an ad after every other song and it’s getting ridiculous. Can’t do a full workout without listening to 10+ ads which is a lot."
338,Suggestion,5,4/10/2020 1:21,"I love soundcloud, I live off music and always have headphones in I don’t use any other platform. I have a suggestion, what if you were able to dm people, like music artists etc. Also it’d be kinda cool to see when people were listening to music (or what song) it could be a privacy setting they’d have to enable or something. Nothing major I just thought it’d be interesting. No complaints :)"
339,Why I don’t like the ad’s,3,1/18/2021 7:00,"I really don’t like most of the ads that are shown. One reason is because they’re always about pads and tampons which some girls can find really embarrassing because I know I do. I hate the fact that I’m listening to music without earbuds because of course not everyone has earbuds or headphones and than I get an ad about periods, pads, and tampons like it’s seriously embarrassing for someone to hear that especially if your trying to listen to music with another friend. :/"
340,Likes + Lag,2,1/8/2021 15:49,"Liked tracks on SoundCloud always go missing. I don’t know if this is just because they are simply being taken off your likes or if it’s because how easy it is to accidentally unlike a track, like all you need to do is click the heart and it’s gone. Please add a dislike confirmation to stop this, it’s really bothersome
Edit : this app is also super laggy when it’s installed for over a month, I have to reinstall it all the time because the lag of scrolling through large playlist/likes is incredibly laggy"
341,"Amazing, but there’s one problem",4,12/16/2020 12:33,"I love this app, it’s really amazing. You can play any music you want but there is one problem with the ads, every time I play a song once there’s a ad right? No biggie I watch it go on with my music. But when I put it on repeat at least 2 times another ad pops up like why? I already saw a ad I don’t need to see another one again, it’s really annoying and I hope this gets fixed."
342,Let’s talk about SoundCloud,2,10/26/2020 13:48,So if you are reading this keep reading so I have been using sound cloud for over 4 years now and up until year 4 I could listen to music off line if I loaned to it onece when I was online and a get that I was still fine with it cuz I had data but in my school I barraly get one bar so I got SoundCloud go beacuse it says offline listing and it’s content work yes I don’t get ads but I can’t listen to it offline if SoundCloud could respond and help me out I would gladly change my review to a 5 star beacuse I do love this app
343,Continues to run in background,2,4/21/2020 23:31,"Haven’t had any issues until recently the app will apparently run in the back ground so even when I’ve closed it if I connect to Bluetooth it will just start playing. Even if I double click to try and close the app the phone doesn’t recognize that it’s open. It even got my car radio stuck in a reboot loop for a while until I figured out SoundCloud was causing the issue and uninstalled it. Googling the issue shows people have had this happening for at least 4 years now, it’s a shame because I really liked the app."
344,Suggestion,5,6/9/2020 7:03,"Great app. Love it and stuff but I really think it would make your users happy to add the ability to pair your phone SoundCloud to the console SoundCloud, like Xbox or PlayStation. So you could control what song plays next or switch through songs on your console through the phone. Plenty of apps already do this so I believe it would be very beneficial for your app and satisfying for your users. Me included. :)"
345,DEBILITATING BUG PLEASE FIX,2,5/3/2022 2:23,In the latest version as of writing this if you listen to a song and your screen turns off the song will turn off around a minute after. This means to listen to ANY SONG for any meaningful period of time I have to turn off battery saving mode so my screen won’t darken out my phone on the charger and my phone after two songs is hot so I have to stop listening so I’m no longer able to use the app all because of this SINGULAR BUG just fix it this app is usually really good but now I can’t use it period.
346,Uhh…,3,10/8/2021 22:23,"Ok, this app worked fine for awhile. Sure, there were a lot of ads, (I can recite the “Sleep Number 360 Smart Bed” ad from memory now) but it served its purpose just fine. However, just today, I tried uploading a song, (keep in mind that I have uploaded quite a few songs before) and it just didn’t work. At all. It would upload, stay there for about 10 seconds, then *poof* vanish. Huh? I’ll put my review back up to 5 stars if/when this issue gets fixed. Thanks."
347,SO BAD,1,2/12/2021 18:04,"Terrible with the free version. HORRIFIC. Every 3-5 songs (even if I don’t listen to them & just skip thru) i receive a 15-30 second long ad that can’t be skipped. Sometimes even back to back. You also MUST stay on the app to get thru the ad. If you navigate away from the app during an ad, the app just completely stops functioning until you decide to play the ad again until finished. There is no cancelling the ad. Which forces me to ask, who actually thought this was a good idea? I mean this is literally the WORST FREE MUSIC APP AVAILABLE. Do yourself a favor & get SPINRILLA! 1 star review only because I can’t give zero"
348,I LOVE THIS APP! but I have something I need help with and a recommendation.,4,1/19/2021 16:18,"This app is amazing! It has all of the songs I want to listen too, even the slowed versions! 

But I need help with something. I cant seem to view my “next up” songs, I’ve been looking everywhere but it won’t show on the app. I also have a recommendation, Can you make it so you can loop playlists or turn off auto play? 

Other than that, the app is awesome and I love it!"
349,Great Music App!,4,8/26/2020 15:46,"Soundcloud has been super good for providing ALMOST ALL Free music!
Good layout, and the way they show the music is different and cool.
Also... I love how u can comment!  It’s a lot like YT in that way :3
The only thing,
First of all I remember a few yrs ago it was really easy to download music, which is the reason I got SoundCloud (I could be wrong but I remember that being the case),
 But when I downloaded it recently, I saw there wasn’t an option to download songs :/
(instead their making u pay for offline use)

I think we should be able to download free songs that we can listen to, like if the Internet goes out, or if we’re in a location where Internet isn’t available (like jogging on a trail).

Otherwise, Everything about SoundCloud is pretty cool!  
I recommend getting this app :)"
350,Play Style,5,4/2/2020 5:30,"I have loved this app forever; it’s amazing. I’d love to, however, have a feature added to where you can quickly decide when the songs stop playing. A good example would be a feature where you can listen to an album or EP all the way through and then the music stops instead of playing songs that are similar to that of the album or EP. Thank you!"
351,Good app but new update made the app useless,3,6/13/2022 14:26,I’ve had all over 4 years this app is good for whenever you wanna vibe to music but lately since the new update I feel like the app is useless example when I go to search up a song it says “it looks like something went wrong try again” neither do the songs that I’ve already listened to load is really frustrating and annoying coming from someone who has had this app for a very long time
352,The App keeps kicking me out,1,9/4/2021 20:29,I was having a perfect day so I decided to go on the app but then I noticed it started kicking me out of the app several real times so I decided to delete the app and reinstall it but when I went to do something and came back it never installed while I was gone so I then decided to install it and make sure it did but then when I tapped the installl button the App would just load for 1 second and then cancel the download idk if it’s my phone or my App Store but I can no longer use the app if it’s a problem with just the app can you try to fix it please?
353,"Will always use, but have recommendation.",5,8/24/2020 17:38,"This app is something that I will always use for when I play music. But I have one request. When you go to your playlist, you go to the top. I was wondering if you could have an update with the listener could go to his playlist and he goes to the song he’s listening to. Thanks for making a great app!!!!"
354,NEW BUG CRASHES APP,1,6/20/2021 2:40,"i love SoundCloud and spend almost all of my free time with my earbuds in listening to music for several hours a day. The amount of songs on here compared to other music apps is much more preferable and there are much fewer ads than on other apps, so listening, even without premium, is amazing. And I would 100% recommend SoundCloud to anyone who wants more music (the premium prices are even pretty good considering the amount of songs on it!) 💛💛💛💛

HOWEVER 

the latest update created a massive bug in the app where it restarts itself if 

• my phone opens another app while playing music
• my phone turns off (not powered off)
• I listen to more than 5 minutes and/or one five minute song 

I have re-downloaded the app,  restarted my phone, cleared other apps for storage, and it still won’t go away! 

I remember a similar problem about a year ago, but that was minimal compared to this one now!!"
355,Suggestions,5,2/27/2020 9:38,Can you add a download all button to the playlist section so i don’t have to download all of them individually? Also can we get a shuffle all in the playlist section so i can listen to every song instead of a specific playlist. I feel like these changes would make soundcloud an even better app to use.
356,SoundCloud is ok,3,5/13/2020 18:50,"The app is ok and allows you to listen to some unofficial and hidden tracks from popular artists today and new artists. Even though SoundCloud offers many songs, it doesn’t recommend any songs based off of your history and preferences and the only playlists on the app are made up of what’s trending and usually older songs. I also wish that SoundCloud offered an Apple Watch version as I play most of my music from my watch instead of directly from my phone."
357,Soundcloud is absolute garbage.,1,4/24/2020 18:04,"An app in the App Store but they have no control over the issues regarding their app. 
I was charged for the app a premium account for the month and began to hear commercials when using the app. I contacted their support and this is their response. 
“Hey there, 
Thanks for getting in touch. It looks like you either have logged in to the wrong account or not activated your subscription with Apple. 
Since your purchase was made through Apple, we have no control over it, therefore we suggest you directly get in touch with Apple for any additional info or refund request.”- Carl

How would my account not be activated when 1. The subscription has been recurring? 2. I provided them with screenshots and my account name and profile were included and can be seen. 

If you’re going to use this service I wouldn’t bother paying for it. Since the developers and people at SoundCloud have no control over their service once an issue occurs."
358,Why,5,6/18/2022 2:30,"Did you make everything bigger for older people like the text size on the iPhone? No old people are using the app, whyyyyyyyyyy??
Why ? I’m confused. 
I’ll never stop using only SoundCloud, but I’m not 65 and I don’t need everything to be larger, that update was not the move. But I guess I’ll have to get used to it. 
5 stars always, it’s SoundCloud. But not stoked on that update."
359,"Great app,  just one issue",4,6/13/2022 16:06,"I've been using this app for a really long time now but one thing is that I had opened the app today and the home said something had went wrong and to try again, so I tried again but the same message appeared so I deleted the app and download it again logged in but now all my liked tracks are all gone I was hoping to find a way to fix this issue"
360,What happened?,1,4/30/2021 18:06,"I’ve used sound cloud for over two years now and have almost 800 likes tracks, I love music and the people I follow on SoundCloud. But now most of my liked tracks are now go + for absolutely no reason at all, and when I checked to see if the same liked tracks were go + on my friends account they weren’t. I’ve tried everything thing to get my account fixed but nothing has worked. I finally broke down an just made a new account but then I couldn’t even like all my tracks again. I am very disappointed in what’s become of this app."
361,SoundCloud,5,11/12/2020 23:28,Honestly I love SoundCloud because I don’t even have to be on WiFi to listen to my favorite songs and plus while your playing a game you can play it in the background and last thing you can play whatever song you want whenever you want you don’t have to have premium just to play any song you want.
362,Pretty Major Issue,1,9/2/2022 1:14,"I’m not sure if this is a loading problem but I just had a bunch of songs clear out of my playlists, some of my playlists don’t even have songs anymore. If they were deleted I could understand but the number of tracks in the playlist stays the same and on one of my playlists one of the songs loaded(?) back up but not the others. A pretty big issue to say the least, especially since of my playlists had over 180 songs on it and if they got removed off my playlist but weren’t actually deleted."
363,Single Downloads,3,7/30/2021 5:46,"Very decent app all around except for a few things but my main issue is that you can’t download a single track and/or mix, it has to be an entire playlist which takes up a lot of data sometimes. I see others having issues with GarageBand and Logic pro so an overall clean up and refreshment of the app would be real nice, especially for those of us who pay for premium. Please fix this immediately!!!🙏🏼"
364,Reporting Bug that NEEDS to be fixed,1,9/26/2020 15:40,"Okay. I tried to report audio for having bad content. The right thing to do right? Well what a BIG surprise you CAN'T report it. It just says that it won't send and to try again in a few minutes. I do that over and over again and nothing happens. I do EVERYTHING that I can just to report an audio that is bad and NOTHING. Fix it. NOW. And don't give me your ""Developer Response"" saying to contact you. I know it's just a bot sending that to people. And besides, I can't contact you because I have restrictions. PLEASE FIX THIS ISN'T GOOD AND IF YOU DON'T FIX IT I WILL NOT MAKE IT 5 STARS AGAIN AND THAT IS FINAL!"
365,Been using SoundCloud forever but it’s gone downhill,3,8/21/2020 18:25,I’ve been using SoundCloud since my freshman year of high school and I am now a jr in college. It used to have ads pretty far spaced out. Now it’s practically after every 2-3 songs. Also has a glitch where every month majority of my songs will change to “SoundCloud Go” even though the day before all those same songs were available to regular SoundCloud. After some time it will switch back but I still stress that one time they won’t.
366,Where’s the next up/queue button?,5,7/4/2021 21:56,For some reason on the iOS/iPhone version of SoundCloud the next up button is missing and we’re only allowed to loop a single song instead of our playlists. I still think it’s a 10/10 app but we seriously need that button to be added to this version.
367,Variety Is The Spice of Life,5,4/8/2021 1:35,"SoundCloud has the most variety of music compared to many of the other music apps. I can always find what I'm looking for no matter what the genre, artist or song. And then there is the music I wasn't looking for that I always come across something new. I've added so much music to my library just from surfing the App!"
368,EVERYTHING IS GREAT EXCEPT...,5,11/21/2020 21:22,The whole app is amazing!! I love finding random ppl as I don’t like to listen to mainstream artists (rap) because they tend to sound the same. You just have to scroll down the playlist & delete it. I just wish it was easier to delete songs out of your playlist like typing it in & having the delete symbol or something.
369,Pretty much perfect,5,8/13/2020 22:06,"I have an idea: being able to download the image of the song we are playing or whatever the person who posted it has as the background 

and one problem if you have a duplicated playlist DO NOT delete it because then you’ll lose the original playlist i’ve had to redo two or three 80 song playlists"
370,Little problem,4,10/9/2020 4:29,The only problem is that o can’t always find the song that I need like day n night by kid Cudi I spent 20 minutes looking for it and all there was and there’s that GO+ which isn’t fair for people because they are offering better audio and all these tracks that other people can’t listen to when  those features should be available in the first place.
371,Won’t play set list all the way through after recent update,5,7/28/2020 0:31,"Song will not stay playing. Recent upgrade makes app too annoying to use. Songs randomly stop playing and randomly switches songs in the middle of another. Also, ads now in middle of music. Use to love this app, now I think it is junk."
372,All of the songs are “go+”,5,4/6/2020 8:55,"I was listening to my normal playlist this morning, I go to school for the day, and when I come back, every song I have in any of my playlists became “go+”. Every song by xxxtentacion, juice wrld, Roddy Rich, or any popular song creator whatsoever is now limited to go+. If We don’t get our music back, or if SoundCloud doesn’t come to a compromise, they are going to lose all their listeners."
373,Useful Music App,5,1/12/2020 4:57,"It’s Pretty Amazing It’s Better Than Any Other Music App This One You can’t make your own music also listen to songs you usually don’t find on any other music app but it’s useful for times when your studying, drawing, walking, relaxing, and just being alone which is sad but it helped for me I’m drawing right now so yeah this is what I could say also 11/10 app ur welcome and goodnight🤗🤗🤗😪😪😪😴😴 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️"
374,Make this iWatch compatible! Plz,5,4/29/2022 11:23,"I’ve used this app for years now. It’s the best way to get EDM music and stay on the pulse of what’s new. So many weekly shows and I use this app at least five days a week when at the gym. With the Apple Watch becoming more powerful, popular, and the bugs being worked out it’s about time SC get on board. Please listen to us developers."
375,It won’t work,3,6/13/2022 16:05,"So I’ve had SoundCloud for a long while now and there is a recent update that won’t let me listen to anything it says I don’t have connection and to “retry”. It’s been like this for a day and a half and I very much have very good connection because I’m able to watch yt, Netflix, look up thinfs on safari without any problems. I’m very upset because I really love this app, I’m not sure if it’s my phone itself or it’s just the new update :( Ty for reading ❤️"
376,Wonderful App,5,4/10/2022 17:09,"This app is amazing it’s so much fun it has every song you can imagine (there are clean versions of all songs) there are even theme songs on it to shows and stuff. In sound cloud, there are also playlists of likeTikTok  mashup songs or anime songs, even edit audios/remix’s. No this is not a fake review from their company lol. Like you must download this app!!!"
377,Ads going brazy,3,9/22/2021 17:30,This app used to be booomb but I’ve had this app long enough to start noticing how it went from barely any ads to now one ads and sometimes even 2 vid ads 15+ sec long ! What’s next 3 vid ads 4 5 or we have to pay … it’s just ridiculous how companies are so greedy they would rather make deals to make more money than to stick to their originality. I can barely handle 2 15+ sec commercial please don’t make it 3 cuz I’ll throw my phone n regret it
378,Recent issue,2,3/10/2022 15:03,"I’ve been enjoying the app and listening to the music provided, but there’s an issue with my liked playlist. I’ve been trying to remove some songs from that list and when I attempt to unlike them, they just reappear at the top of the list. The opposite happens when I try to add a new song to the liked list where it would appear for a second before disappearing from that list and not being “liked.” What is going on and is this happening to anyone else?"
379,Revamp your entire company,1,7/31/2021 0:39,"I have loved and used SoundCloud for almost 10 years but I swear every year since 2012 this app has gotten worse.

——————
Here’s a list of things that you CAN’T do on the app:

Look at descriptions of songs

Message others

Listen to a song I JUST LISTENED TO again after losing service, despite the fact it should be cached

Scroll entirely through your likes

AND

Scrolling through likes quickly (the app lags and hangs while scrolling)

——————-

This is downright pathetic and disgusting coming from a company who tries to come off like they support the little guy. Look up the owners/operators of SoundCloud, it’s a list of suited up, old white men who have no idea how technology works or how to stay ahead of the curve. 

I can’t wait for the day some other music takes you guys off the face of the internet. DON’T download this app. SoundCloud has become the thing they promised not to be."
380,Is it just me or what?,5,7/23/2021 2:49,"The app is nice and all but I have one little problem, the problem being that sometimes whenever I remove a track from liked tracks, it just returns and I have to like and unlike it over and over again until it’s actually gone. Other than that it’s really good."
381,Review,5,5/17/2021 1:35,I absolutely love SoundCloud no matter if you have a subscription or not you can find almost any song you were looking for one of the best music apps that has ever been produced not only can you make your playlists but you can listen to thousands of other playlists from people all over the world awesome app great job
382,Weird pet peeve,5,4/17/2021 8:22,"I wake up in cold sweats sometimes realizing I haven’t listened to a song in a long time because fit one reason or another it was taken down. Who knows how many of my favorite songs I’ve forgotten about over the years because they’ve been silently taken off my likes. There NEEDS to be some sort of notifications. Plz, thx."
383,NO LOGIN INFO to use other apps,2,5/9/2021 9:09,"I only Sign In with Apple ID

I have had this app for a long time and wasn’t using it until recently so I signed in with my Apple ID. The problem is, a lot of other apps allow you to use your Soundcloud account for whatever ab services you’re using but you have to sign in. 

When you sign in with Apple ID you don’t have an email address and password to sign in with... so either I don’t get to us The many apps that allow SoundCloud accts or there is another way to find this information out or create it? I’ve looked all over the site and cannot see anywhere to update email address or password. It’s really frustrating... especially since I have a SoundCloud upgraded  account. So I may have to cancel if this is not figured out and no one seems to answer on Twitter or anywhere.

384,SoundCloud is a 5/5 app and here’s why,5,3/15/2021 18:19,"SoundCloud doesn’t much ads when listening also 
You can listen to any song plus if you search a certain song up its comes up and you can decide to listen to the other versions of the song or just the original version of the song which I think is cool"
385,❗️FIX THIS NOW❗️,3,11/2/2020 22:39,"It is great and I get to listen to what ever song I want. There are a few problems though, When I don’t even have the app open it randomly starts playing and I didn’t even click the play button’ another thing wrong is that it randomly stops in the middle of the song and that also annoys me. Please fix these issues... You have to fix this issue because if you don’t than people are gonna stop using your app."
386,You’re slowly ruining yourselves,2,10/19/2020 15:07,"This used to be my favorite streaming app of all time but you ruined it with ads that I can’t even skip. AND. You’ve pretty much rendered the app useless by making it so that the phone needs internet to listen to a song that I’ve been bumping over and over again, constantly using my data. I live in NY so it’s impossible for me to listen to music unless I want to have my song stopped everytime I go into the tunnel on the subway. Keep this up and you’re gonna go out of business"
387,Loved the app. Until...,2,10/12/2020 19:14,"Once I updated the app (I hit the update button by accident) and opened to hear my fave playlist, I got bombarded by ads. 
Constantly interrupted with ads... After nearly every track, 2 commercials played and couldn’t be skipped. Even pausing a forced advertisement froze up and shut down the app. 
Sorry SoundCloud. I understand running a
Company takes money and that sales drive growth, but you went overboard. 
Perhaps times are tight at HQ, so I’ll be forced to look for my go-to music platform elsewhere."
388,No queue,3,3/17/2020 17:58,"I love SoundCloud but the fact you can’t create a queue when listening to music unless you are using your computer (like literally every other streaming platform) basically makes it the least user friendly streaming platform out there. If it wasn’t for the fact that there’s music on soundcloud that is too underground to be found anywhere else, SoundCloud would essentially be useless. This feels like an easy fix, just add a queue, I don’t understand why they haven’t."
389,this app def needs a new look and software update,5,7/6/2022 20:11,"I use SoundCloud on my computer and to add a song to a playlist you have to go to the song do this and that it needs to be simple, it needs a new look to keep it looking new and not sluggish. ads are another thing, their are like 3 ads after two songs"
390,Better than most apps,4,7/29/2022 19:04,"Okay, so I'm just going to get right into this. I've been using SoundCloud for probablyyyy 2-3 years and this is the first time I'm having this issue. Whenever I try to like a song it doesn't work. I don't know if that’s the artists doing or if it's just a bug. But I haven't been able to like ANY songs for the past 3 days and it's really annoying me. That's all though."
391,Great music,5,3/1/2022 8:01,Great great app loaded with lots of music and it’s very well designed. Myself I don’t think you can go wrong with SoundCloud on Anny subscription. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants a lot of music whether they like ads or no ads while listening to music. But I said check it out and see what you think and enjoy your music
392,Deleted app because it wasn’t playing songs when connected to WIFI.,4,6/13/2022 13:51,"Hi I been using SoundCloud for years and it was connected to WiFi and wouldn’t play my liked songs, I ended up having to delete the app and lost the liked songs after I reinstalled the app and signed in and I want to know how to get my liked songs and playlists back. Could you fix this issue"
393,This is so nice,5,9/8/2021 15:31,"You can’t listen to every song, but you can listen to the songs posted, offline and without having to be on the app, of course there’s ads but that’s perfectly fine, just restart the app really quick. it has an autoplay so you discover new songs to jam out to or vibe to. just a solid 11/10"
394,Since high school,5,5/27/2021 1:11,"I’ve been here since I was around 14. I really enjoy this app still today, I may not like the ads in between, sometimes they’re funny so I won’t buy premium for that reason. I also enjoy hearing sounds you’d otherwise never hear from mainstream radios or artists, so that’s a huge plus for me. Thanks SoundCloud for all that."
395,Your Music Makes it all so Real,5,6/9/2020 12:16,I met a guy a few years ago that was so amazing and he needed a few cars and to be bailed out of jail.  Your music helped me through the tough decisions on whether to stay with my family or to run off with a member of the mafia.  Sometimes the same song would play and it made me certain I was always doing the right thing.  even in my vulnerable state.
396,Crashes more than a test dummy driver,1,2/14/2021 20:29,"How many versions is it going to take SC to fix the crashing issue???? I’m a paid subscriber and all I want to do is listen to music without interruption. Several times a day in the middle of playing a song the app crashes and stops playing music. Then when I reboot the app it doesn’t remember any of my play history so if I’ve been listening to a 2 hour dj mix and I’m halfway through it , I’ll have to start the track all over again. Really annoyed to have to deal with this constantly. It crashes several times a day."
397,Crashes when I skip multiple songs,4,1/7/2021 3:06,"I love soundcloud, without a doubt. I have had premium for over 4 years now but for some reason when I skip multiple songs that are already downloaded to my devices it completely crashes the app. Hope it gets fixed as it has been like this for a year or two.

Fix that and it’s 5 stars :)"
398,"Essential app, but Ads need to be fixed.",3,9/4/2020 15:27,"I’ve always loved being able to stream music for free using SoundCloud. I don’t mind hearing an advertisement or two because I understand that’s how artists and the company make their money, but hearing the same advertisement over and over again for weeks makes it hard to like this app anymore. Nothing wrong with making free-users listen to an ad once in a while, but the same one over and over again makes it very irritating."
399,Go vs. Pro why have both?,1,8/20/2020 4:21,"I decided after being a long time free user to make the leap into a Pro account because I wanted to launch my music career and enjoy ad free music in the mean time. Now my access is being limited again because I won’t give you even more money?! This is beyond scummy and I’m going to tell everyone I know to avoid your platform. My recommendation do one or the other. If Go is your new paid version, cool, I will go with that. Continuing the current practice creates bad faith especially for people like me who are already extremely reluctant to pay for services like this. Sincerely, a very disgruntled app user."
400,Need glitch improvement asap,2,4/23/2020 13:47,I should not have to pay for this if A simple problem cannot be fixed after contacting numerous times and no contact back. SoundCloud is a great streaming service but for the last few months it’s been closing my tab every 2-5 minutes which is irritating as songs aren’t even that long most the time and I pay for this. I’ve tried deleting the app worked for a month now it’s back to constantly closing and it’s driving me crazy. I may have to entirely get rid Of my premium service.
401,Log in issues,2,2/12/2020 18:44,"This app is awful. I’ve been trying to sign in after an update to no avail. It just gives me an error message—whether it’s with my email and password or when trying to log in through FB. But I can login online. Glad I didn’t go pro and pay for this. And now I never will. When I looked at the help section on this issue, they gave the same canned response and then didn’t answer several people complaining about the same issue later on. Bad service for an app trying to get me to pay for an upgrade."
402,Very great but...,4,1/12/2020 18:04,"Your app has too many glitches! There has been too many times where your app glitches and I can’t listen to all my music anymore because of it. Lately, there is this glitch that makes me have to pay for SoundCloud go+ if I want to listen to music from official artists and that has never been the case. So, I and many others would very much appreciate you guys fixing this glitch. Thanks very much."
403,Soundcloud Quick Review,5,6/1/2022 19:22,"I use it primarily as a playlist for more obscure (depending on your home country culture) EDM songs.  I has most of them available for free which makes it great for me to get free music for listening to an add every few songs.  More mainstream music is copyrighted l, therefore you must have an account with them to unlock it.  Happy listening!"
404,It’s good but confusing,3,6/13/2022 23:52,I’ve been using SoundCloud for a few years now but the most recent update has me confused. I typically like to keep my listening history clear when I use it especially at night but since the clear history button was removed I can no longer do that all I wish is for the clear listening history button to be returned with no other UI changes following. Thank you.
405,Best place for the rarest streaming,5,3/9/2022 1:19,Before the streaming revolution it was a thing to find the rarest most obscure b-sides from your favorite bands. Maybe you could find a download and had to find that rare recording on a CD. SoundCloud is the place I go to find those rare albums you won’t find Anywhere else. Thank you SoundCloud for making this platform.
406,Long time user,5,2/14/2020 1:47,I really love the music that’s on here. A lot of popular stuff but even more hidden talents. I love finding something/someone I’ve never heard before that just fits my tastes. Sometimes the unknown songs I love become known and I end up hearing them on the radio. It’s cool to know you loved them and recognized the talent that pushed them into the spotlight. It feels like you’re a part of their success.
407,SoundCloud Go+,1,7/18/2020 21:46,"They recently decided that all of Juice, X, and pop smokes music AND features should require SoundCloud GO+. This left my playlists filled with previews. These artists were always free to listen to and would never require Go+ for there music. If this doesn't change its honestly not worth using the app and it would be better to use a different streaming service. I hope they fix this if not I would be moving onto other apps and for the meantime I will not be using this and I will only make periodic checks to see if they changed this."
408,"I love it, but all apps have their flaws",4,4/2/2020 16:45,It’s the best way that I can watch music without getting a lot of adds and the adds are short and simple. I can listen to music even when I don’t have any WiFi.  I’m not sure if it’s SoundCloud or me but for some reason my music keeps stopping randomly. I’ve tried fixing it but nothing worked. SoundCloud will probably fix it soon though because it seems like a simple glitch.
409,What happened to the quality after the major update?,2,3/20/2020 22:41,"I’ve used this since the app was first launched, and I’ve loved it. The readings were accurate, it didn’t take long for a song to load, the interface was simple, and it was a pleasure to use. 

The major update a few weeks ago made it unusable - the most important thing is tagging music to find it, and the app can’t do it like before. It’s a shame because I really like it...I hope in a few months it’ll get figured out. Until then I’ll have to go to their competition."
410,Sound cloud,5,1/4/2020 17:10,"It’s so much more than a music app you can be in school for playing and teacher wouldn’t even know I know from experience but it’s the fact that’s it’s not really that many adds so you can listen to
Music care free and turn of you phone and vibe to your music so think about this you can be in school or at work and don’t wanna get caught SOUNDCLOUD that’s it bye plz get SoundCloud plz"
411,Good app when functioning,3,1/10/2020 21:23,"Very slow app that tends to get overwhelmed and crash when browsing any artists profile, checking recently played, or even clicking into the song that is already playing.  Could use a huge overhaul from a performance standpoint since I find myself waiting 30+ seconds sometimes just to be able to get to a song I want to play and having it load. This is even done on WiFi or LTE so likely not due to connectivity issues."
412,Amazing! Happy for over a year,5,6/16/2022 1:14,"Can’t think of anything negative. If you want country music or pop, be willing to by a 10 dollar/month payment. Taylor swift has two older songs that can be listened to without Go+ and mist country music requires Go+ deeply recommend for Hip Hop and other genres. Limited ads, short ads, easy to use app."
413,"I can now play songs whenever I tap on them now, thanks",5,6/15/2022 15:28,"Whenever I click on a song, it doesn’t play; furthermore, whenever I tap on a song, all I get was a screen saying “loading error, tap to try again”. Now I can really play songs without seeing “loading error, tap to try again”; thanks."
414,Best music app ever!!,5,6/15/2021 20:19,"The music quality is amazing. The fact that you can turn your phone off while listening to music is astonishing and not only that but the fact that you meet so many new artists is AWESOME!! This app is a 5 Star, I hope the developers are safe in this pandemic and I wish you guys hope thank you for Sound Cloud."
415,Can’t like songs anymore,3,6/13/2022 17:09,I’ve had SoundCloud for years now and I love it. However with this new recent update I’ve no longer been able to like songs. Whenever I like songs it’ll show up for a moment before un-liking itself. I’m not sure if this is because of the update or something else but I hope it gets fixed. I don’t usually review apps but I use this app daily and would like to continue using it as I have.
416,No track description on iPhone??,1,8/20/2021 16:43,"I intentionally put all my credits in the description so people can see the names of the artists who helped me with the mixing, mastering, cover art, etc. for my song releases. I always work from a PC, so I am just now realizing that the track description is not available at all on iPhones? I’ve been paying annual fees to keep my music uploaded but my fans can’t even read the description I post on their phones? B.S. 1/5 trash developers must’ve never made a mobile app before. So many useless bells & whistles and no actual functionality!"
417,Soundcloud,5,9/8/2020 2:38,First I am going to start off my saying if you like all types of songs but can’t really find a app that is free with all music on it SoundCloud is there to help and to be honest I really like SoundCloud and highly recommend SoundCloud and lastly if you like the song on SoundCloud you can listen to it when your out of data
418,UX issues,3,1/13/2021 10:29,"I won’t talk about sound cloud as a service. Its perfect for artist and music diggers.
What I don't like is the interface of the app. There are a lot of things working without any logic. I play a track from someones profile and in the next up which I can not see btw there is a previous track as next but not next track. I can add a track to next up, but i can not add a playlist to next up.
It is hard to navigate through the app."
419,Disappointed during flight,3,10/7/2020 9:23,I’ve had SoundCloud for over a year and upgraded so I can listen offline.  Although I’ve downloaded my selections most of them don’t play when I’m on the plane.  It defeats the whole reason why I pay $14/month.  I travel every week and just want my music while flying.  It is disappointing when I can’t play the songs that I downloaded offline.  False claims on being able to listen offline.
420,Find ALL the music,5,12/20/2020 16:18,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for years now and the amount of new stuff that I find daily is amazing. Any type of music you can think of by any artist in any country that has this app or website, it’s crazy good. Now, they just need a store to buy the all the music that you can’t find anywhere else."
421,This is annoying,4,7/6/2022 5:21,"One thing got fixed. And another problem appeared. I originally had a problem with a specific string of songs playing after a couple auto play songs, (Which I think we’d all agree is super annoying) and I SUPPOSE it could be called “fixed”  though…. Now there’s just NO autoplay. My playlist will end. And then there’s NOTHING. It’s very disappointing."
422,Almost there!,3,4/13/2022 2:13,Hello! I love Soundcloud and the design and functionality. However something very obvious is missing for the Soundcloud phone app. You cannot view track details! Many artists post long mixes and add the artist names and song titles in their setlist. It would be incredibly helpful to add this simple functionality. I can only view track info on the web version. Please forward this to your development team! Thank you 🙏🏽
423,SoundCloud 😕,4,1/25/2021 19:52,I love this app some much I use it on road trips and everything! But.. there has been some problems lately so I was trying to change my profile. And it said verify email so I did I pressed on the link so I tried to do my profile again and still same thing. I got very frustrated. Why do people even have to verify their email for a app. SoundCloud figure it out!!!
424,Great music app,5,6/1/2020 4:09,Before I used SoundCloud I tried pandora which doesn’t let you like specific songs you like only the style of music witch shuffles and usually plays songs I don’t like but with SoundCloud it’s way easier you can choose specific songs to add to your playlist if you want a music app you should get SoundCloud 10/10 would recommend
425,Great—until recent update,4,7/16/2020 1:22,"I truly love this app and have used it for almost a year now—however, ever since the recent update, it’s been horribly glitchy. Every time I try to play a song, it glitches and closes out of the app, taking me back to the home screen. Trying again only causes it to repeat the glitch. Hopefully I’m not the only one having this problem, and it will be fixed soon :)"
426,SoundCloud is the best but,5,4/12/2020 0:28,"Like the other user said, most songs that get taken down are leaks. Some aren’t but it would be great if you take down a song, put it on a section or category. The name is like, “Music that was taken down from your playlist or liked music” that way I know where it’s being kept or the names. Thank you for reading and I love the app :)"
427,Amazing!,5,4/4/2020 21:26,"I love that you can just go to any song that you want to, most of the songs I listen to aren’t very well known, but SoundCloud still has it on there. When I find the album/ playlist that my song went to, it paired all the songs it thinks I might like, to be honest it helped me find my new favorite song! I highly recommend you download this amazing app!"
428,Follow your favorite music...,5,4/1/2020 11:33,"Get all of the info you truly need about an ever expanding variety of musical genres, artists, amateur composers... all in one intuitive, easy to use and diligently updated app. 
My only beef with SoundCloud is that you have to log in with a computer in order to block an undesirable follower. You can't do that within the app. 
Otherwise, I'm extremely impressed."
429,Amazing! But i have a suggestion,5,4/1/2022 5:48,"I love this app alot! In fact its the only app i use for music. But i do have 1 suggestion.

So just like how on desktop, users can loop individual songs or playlists (on shuffle or not), and it would be very nice if mobile users could have this too!

Especially if you want to listen to a few songs on loop but cant because there isnt a loop button.

Anyways thank you and i hope to see this feature soon :)

Ps. Yes i already submitted something like this but yk it would be a good feature to have
And no, the time im submitting this (april fools) does not affect this review. A loop feature would genuinely be a good feature :)"
430,Stopped paying premium,3,7/31/2022 21:40,"Stopped paying for this app and it suddenly glitches consistently. I
For example I’m half way through a single song I’ve been trying to listen to for 10 minutes. It keeps crashing time and time again. It eventually stops but it always comes back. Deleted and re downloaded. Only thing that has changed is that I’m not paying them money so now it’s buggy."
431,"Love it so much, always been great since launch",5,6/4/2020 21:44,"Soundcloud is a really good music platform, literally has music that is fire “af” if you can find them haha, am having one problem right now since this month don’t know if I should uninstall then reinstall but when I go to my likes it’s been taking about 1-2 mins to load idk what that’s about but any info would be nice."
432,It keeps crashing,3,12/20/2021 3:24,"Since some time, the quality of some songs that Soundcloud provide gets worse than before and it keeps crashing and pausing without any action. Wondering if it happens on my iPhone or others as well. Used to listen songs through Soundcloud apps, I ended up looking for other music streaming apps. Please improve this kinda stuff so that I could keep using it. Thanks for the good service tho."
433,Only two things,4,11/12/2021 3:08,Everything is great and works perfectly well but what would be even better is if they let us change our playlists picture instead of having our playlist picture as our first song. It would also be cool if they added an equalizer for our songs to be smooth
434,App constantly crashing since last update,3,12/16/2020 1:40,"I can’t even finish listening to a short playlist and it doesn’t give an error message. Also what happened with the option to be able to see all the songs and repeat the playlist? Before those could be chosen directly from the song playing, now I can’t find it and have to do it with at least three steps in between :/"
435,Bots,3,9/21/2020 23:35,I love soundcloud because it is an easy way to access good music. The only problem is how many bots and self promoters there are. There should be some way to see when there is a bot. If it the same account saying the exact same thing on multiple songs they should be banned or get a notice. Self promoters aren’t as bad but there a TON of porn bots and it’s not good. Please deal with this issue so we can listen to music in peace without all or the spam.
436,its okay i guess?,3,9/4/2020 20:46,"whenever i start playing a song and close the app to do something else, it cuts off and i have to reopen the app, sit through a ad, play the song again and close out of the app just for it to cut out again.
I usually have to do this like 5 times before it lets me play the song. Please fix this if possible! Also, the 30 second unskippable ads you get every 2 songs is extremely annoying. otherwise, i have to say its...pretty good"
437,I like it but there is one thing I don’t like,5,3/29/2020 0:31,"When I first got it I had no issues. I didn’t have to pay for anything and I didn’t, and all of a sudden it tells me that my 1 month free trial is done that I never paid for. Now all the music that is on a album said it was only for  Preview now for 30 seconds. But all the unreleased music on the app wasn’t for preview so idk?🤷🏻‍♂️😡"
438,"Great,but...",4,4/23/2020 17:36,"I love this app. It is my go to for any sound I need. It also means I get to find all sorts of new music I had no idea I was into. However, I really wish there was someway to organize your liked tracks into alphabetical order or something along those lines. I also wish they would remove the blocks because I have to reorganize my liked tracks and I keep having to put that on hold because of the blocks."
439,SoundCloud fix my account,2,1/14/2020 5:14,I got locked out of my old account and I made a new one so I found my old account and started liking all my old tracks on my old scoundrel and I liked a huge portion and then it at one point it started to unlike my tracks and then I looked it up and it said I followed to ma but people so I waited a day and it started letting me like tracks again and then I starte likening the rest of my tracks on my old account and then it did it again and it’s been almost 4 days and no one has responded to me or fixed anything.
440,Top Two Apps!,5,9/7/2022 3:14,"I’ve been Apple fan since 2011 and I have to say SoundCloud takes the lead when it comes to User Portrait , aesthetics and originality , and community of independent and underground artists … Also, with Apple’s new copyright lock and shift from iTunes to the Music app Djay and ‘Match users are left with an empty library and feelings of vulnerability and rage."
441,Listen to any music that no other app will allow you to listen to,5,11/13/2021 6:39,"Sound Cloud is amazing and is entertaining, you can listen to must songs that other music apps won’t let you. I can listen to them on the go, or whenever I want to, even if my device is off. 10 out of 10 app! 😎"
442,Love it but there’s currently a big issue for me,4,8/28/2022 4:40,"Something has happened and bow i cant use the search bar to quickly type in songs, it takes me to the subscription page design the song being free so you have to hassle for going to ur likes and finding the song there to play it. Very annoying glitch but i like the app regardless"
443,Been a great music app for about 5 years for me,4,8/13/2022 18:10,"Have all the underground music if you go ahead and get that go subscription you also get all the hits. past and present, The only thing I would say now is recently I haven’t been able to shuffle any of my playlist or anything like that so please fix the shuffle button other than that this app is amazing."
444,Return the songs to their previous size,4,6/10/2022 8:35,I’ve been using SoundCloud for the past two years and I don’t really appreciate the most recent update with the scaling of the songs. it now messes up my perception a little and I don’t really like it...all I’m asking is for the developers to revert the scaling back to how it was for the previous updates. that is all
445,Pretty cool but has some problems,4,4/12/2022 0:46,"I love SoundCloud; there's plenty of great music that isn't anywhere else. I do wish that you could loop playlists- unless you can and I'm missing it, and i wish you could upload songs from your phone. It's a hassle to do it from a computer and a phone is easier to access for many people. Other than that it's pretty good :)"
446,REMOVE SONGS THAT ARENT ON SOUNDCLOUD,5,8/27/2021 22:17,Songs that are no longer available on the app do not disappear from liked songs. I will unlike it and it will immediately go back to being liked again. I cant listen to music continuously without it stopping because the songs are no longer available!! Please fix!
447,Why so many adds,5,11/3/2020 22:19,It’s a good app I believe that but I hate how there are so many adds a few months ago when I listened to music on this app there were very few adds and after a update I get adds after every other song and it is a double add so I have 2 adds but other than that it is a good app
448,Why is this happening?,3,5/9/2021 3:14,"The app is mostly good, a few too many ads, sometimes they happen after a single song, but now any time I try to play SC on my car through bluetooth it messes up everything. I can’t play normal music, I try shutting my car off, I try re-connecting my phone, switching devices, nothing works. It just sits there with the song I originally tried to play on Soundcloud and nothing else happens."
449,Man I want to like this app...,1,12/22/2020 2:09,"I really really do. I don’t know where else I can find new music like I can on here. But gosh, SoundCloud, you’re hard to love. Between randomly crashing every 5 minutes when I’m using a Bluetooth speaker, to the most inane playlist/fav track/download system I’ve ever experienced on a music app, you’re ‘bout to make me switch to Apple Music or some crap. Please fix the bugs. Please let me download tracks I want instead of having to like everything then re organize it into playlists instead of one giant list... please..."
450,Soundcloud go+ change need it for 90% of songs now,5,7/24/2020 21:43,I have been using this for four years and all of a sudden now you need sound cloud go+ for 90% of the music in my playlist if this doesn’t change back to how it was I’m uninstalling that simple if they don’t change I would never recommend getting this
451,Ugh SoundCloud,4,10/16/2020 12:00,"I love SoundCloud but it always says “ you made to many comments recently try again later” and I have it takes 3-4 days to comment again I would love if SoundCloud informs you a few comments before it doesn’t let me comment again and the ad’s coming on after almost every song is annoying about vaping, smoking, Julie and the phantoms, etc."
452,Problems,2,7/31/2020 19:28,"Here's what I don't get:
Why does the website have more functionality than the app?
Many a time: I can't do something on the app, say like change an album photo, and I have to switch to the website to do it.
Another gripe:
The app interferes with safari when I use it on my iPad. Whenever I try to open safari, it's automatically opens the SoundCloud app instead. Very annoying. I may delete the app entirely this and continue to use SoundCloud via the website, because overall it's a good platform. Please fix this"
453,Comments,4,7/19/2020 4:36,You guys should work on a algorithm to remove comments that are self promoting and look for keywords and just delete the comments because it’s disgusting to see the comments on an artists music like juice wrld who passed away and all you see in the comments for his music is self promoting crap i mean otherwise soundcloud is one of the absolute best music apps in the world but theres just that one thing that damages the image of soundcloud
454,Great app with 2 flaws,4,2/18/2020 2:25,Good app because it lets me listen to anything offline but the 2 30 second ads between songs are annoying while i have short time to listen to music in between classes. And it’s annoying that when i move around my playlist it takes 3-6 times before the song actually moves which annoys me so much😡 soundcloud fix that pls! Otherwise this is a great app!
455,Don’t Use.,1,4/29/2020 10:26,App runs like literal garbage. The artists and music are the only thing keeping it afloat. No one i know likes soundcloud. The ads are horrendous and the app freezes after selecting like two tracks. Idk what makes the creators think they can charge people what they do for the absolute useless features. If your an artist seek literally any other source for promoting yourself. SoundCloud is a massive waste of time to even scroll though. Because once you find your song and click on it. The app will shutdown. 1/10 would never recommend to anyone.
456,Fix this bug please,5,1/24/2020 13:08,"One problem I’m having is editing my playlist, sometimes when I delete a song it closes the whole app and crashes. Another thing is that I can’t move songs around in my playlist for organization, it also crashes when I click that button to do that. Please fix"
457,Awesome Music Platform,5,6/1/2022 22:38,"Whether you’re looking for new or old music, SoundCloud is the ideal app for you! Discover new music from your favorite artists and rediscover (new) old music from upcoming artists alive! Or if you’re an artist yourself, then allow yourself to be open to the general public, worldwide! Listen to music conveniently at your fingertips freely!"
458,Selecting searched songs no longer plays them,3,8/30/2022 3:20,"When I search a song, it not longer plays one from my list of likes in the search result when I select it. That is moderately annoying as I have to go specifically to my likes to search a song. And for that matter you should be able to add a song to queue from the likes search. The new app format is generally better though."
459,App is good but one teensy problem.,5,2/1/2022 5:01,This app is great I’ve been using since 2018 and didn’t have any issues with it although one problem I made a new account(different email)and cannot access my listening history I would like to know if I did something wrong in the sign in process.
460,Quality,5,11/26/2020 20:51,"I love love love this app

I have one suggestion for the creators . Please try to improve the sound quality at 1 point , I bought the pro version and the sound still the same and that why I stopped paying for it . Fix that and I’ll upgrade to the pay version. Again I love this app. 

Thank you ."
461,Awesome app but the comments…,4,6/22/2021 13:48,I love Sound Cloud. It’s great to use and listen to songs for free. I didn’t buy their subscription but the comment section can vary depending if it’s good or bad. One thing might say the lyric to the song or “I loveee this song!” Then it can go to bots spamming the comment section and the bots sending inappropriate links for you to fall for. All I’m saying is Sound Cloud is a great app but also FIX THE COMMENT SECTION!
462,Please give me back the “Cast” option,5,7/28/2020 3:30,"I was 1000% happy with everything about SoundCloud prior to the last 2-3 updates where the feature that enabled me cast my music to devices on the same WiFi network (my TV) was removed. Please put it back.

Update: they put the feature back on the app and I love it again thank you. Everything is perfect."
463,Overall Pretty Great,5,6/19/2020 20:15,If you don’t have premium they don’t bombard you with ads and you can still do most things without it and they have so many songs from a variety of artists which are both good. The only thing that I would change is the layout is a little bit confusing but other than that it’s great.
464,Best music app ever!,5,4/28/2020 15:40,"I love SoundCloud! This is a great option for people who don't want to pay to listen to music. I love that SoundCloud can play music when your not in the app, and it even plays music while my device is off. SoundCloud has a great selection of great music, in many genres. I would highly recommend this app."
465,Found what I wanted and I love it!,5,1/5/2020 3:44,"I will tell y’all this. Soundcloud has got everything in your favor for your tastes. Also introducing some of the indie versions of those tastes too. Underground and Above all things high. It’s awesome! Thanks to them, I found a lot of tastes in various types of music. A popular one being Emo Rap. Lil Peep being the most popular in my and many other fans opinions (Rest in peace buddy)."
466,I love it but.,3,1/10/2020 17:35,I love this app. It sounds so good in my car it’s better than most apps and I love it has songs no other app does. But now with all this Go+ it’s hard to listen to any music anymore. I understand you guys have to make your money but I feel like it’s kinda expensive and it makes it hard to want the app when you have to pay for all of the music and the ads are the same ones over and over again. But other than those 2 things I  love it
467,Great app!,5,6/9/2021 5:28,"I rate this a 5 star because the app is easy to use and I can even listen to my liked songs without any WiFi or internet. It’s also free for many songs, some songs involve Go+ which cost money, but you can find covers of the same exact song for free by other accounts anyway."
468,Missing simple features,3,6/16/2022 16:28,"loop playlists and being able to see your Up Next list are pretty big features every music app should have. Im surprised. Other than that I love using soundcloud but for the music. The interface is... yeah. For sure 5 stars if it had those features though, i feel like everyone likes to use them. sometimes you just wana zone out to your playlist or tweak your Up Next queue"
469,😀,4,1/12/2022 7:20,"i love this app but omg can it be annoying, sometimes it’ll just crash over and over again and i have to reset my phone to make it work. Sometimes i’ll go on and all my songs will be gone and i have to restart the app to get them to show up, and when it gives me two 30 second ads in a row and makes me wanna delete this app 💀😭"
470,I only have one request,5,6/25/2020 4:30,"So if I am completely honest I probably owe soundcloud my life. I gladly pay for Go and I have had the app for a little over 6 years and it is my main source of music. I love every aspect of it right down to the orange color, okay okay this is becoming strange u get my point. But please, please, allow us to queue things on the mobile app. 

Thank you."
471,Great music app,4,4/15/2021 17:19,"This app has given me music that I would not like but because of the many remixes there are on this music platform, I am now listening to music that I would not have been listening to. I do wish there was app support on the Apple Watch so when I do listen to music when on a walk or jog or even working out, I don’t have to take my phone with me."
472,Why does it skip songs?,4,10/4/2020 20:50,"I’ve been having this problem for a long time now, and I don’t know if it’s just me, but for some reason when I’m listening to soundcloud it just skips over songs. This is super annoying especially when it skips a really good song and your hands are busy. If you guys can please fix this that would be great."
473,too many video ads !!,3,9/6/2020 16:06,"great app but too many ads!! half of them are video ads that you have to watch before you can begin streaming music again. This can get very annoying when youre just trying to change the song and put your phone up but the app forces you to watch the video. I wouldn’t mind if it was an audio ad, because I could just listen while i multitask but instead I have to pick up my phone to watch the ad"
474,Ads,5,3/13/2020 19:46,"Love the app! 100% 5 stars ⭐️  But I do have one complaint, and it’s the ads. If I’m listening to a song I’ll always get the same ad about smoking or dipping and it’s really annoying/repetitive. I know I could just buy go+ but that’s not the issue. It’s just the fact that I get the same ads not the fact that I get ads. Anyways, that’ll be it from me."
475,What happened...,2,3/4/2020 15:28,"Used to be a good platform to find music/live sets. Didn’t mind listening to ads at all, as they weren’t intrusive. Now, I get ads before I even listen to a single song. That’s IF I can even listen to a song. Have been getting constant crashing and freezing the past few days. If you’re going to pull off nonsense like capping the amount of time users can listen to, then stop with the BS ads. I’ll find another platform before paying for GO+, as this is way too buggy a service to pay for"
476,refund me.,2,1/26/2020 0:58,"i’ve been using soundcloud for almost five years now. i had a free trial for a month a year ago, and canceled the subscription after the free month. i recently added a new card number on my icloud, and a day later i got an app receipt in my mail from soundcloud for purchasing soundcloud go using that new card number WITHOUT ME VERIFYING. i requested a refund, but it said my request was not ‘refund-worthy.’ very disappointed. please do something about this problem i don’t even want to listen to soundcloud anymore after this."
477,Soundcloud is trash now,2,1/24/2020 12:53,"I used to love SoundCloud. At first I didn’t like how some songs required money, but that’s how business works. Then the ads got worse.. not 15 second ads.. no. 30 second ads. I’m in the gym everyday and I can tell you that I’d rather throw my phone across the gym than pay for go. YOU KNOW WHAT SOUNDCLOUD DOES?? THEY DOUBLE DOWN!!! Sometimes after a 15 second ad (you feel lucky because it’s finally not a 30 second ad).. a 30 second ad plays right after it!! These ads are getting out of hand and ruining your business!!"
478,It’s lit,5,6/13/2022 13:54,"It would be nice if it was easier to discover new artists with small followings- I think this could also cut down on the self promotions spamming every song. But this app is lit, I don’t have SoundCloud Go, for a free app it’s just awesome and I use it on runs (I run all the time 💀) and while I drive or while I’m just sitting around, it’s the best."
479,SoundCloud is a decent app,4,8/21/2022 20:48,"so SoundCloud is a great app where you can post your music without having to go through the trouble of well, anything really. But it’s one flaw is there are users who follow just so you can see a link in their bio to have virtual s3x. 
yea I don’t think thats too safe for kids as young as 13. But it’s a great social media platform for music lovers and beginners."
480,Why update?,4,6/22/2022 1:04,I see no point in the new update. I prefer the interface that’s in the photos on the App Store. It was simple. Perfect. Now it looks like it’s made for a child and freezes. I had to open the app 30 times just to search one song to add to my liked list. And after all that it’s not even in my list and idk what it was anymore😂
481,Almost useless app,1,6/4/2022 0:11,"Bugs I encounter every single day:

• If I open a soundcloud link, the app plays the audio from the last song while showing the cover art of the new song

• Moves through the waveform as if a song is playing but says 0:00 time elapsed and plays no audio

• Hard crashes randomly that require a full login

• Audio continues playing after clearing app from recents

• “Downloaded” songs still don’t load when playing offline

• Get this message at least 10 times a day: “Downloading paused. iOS has stopped downloading tracks. Open SoundCloud to resume the process.”

Can’t believe a better alternative hasn’t outcompeted soundcloud by now. This app was good a decade ago but literally any other music app is lightyears beyond it. This app needs to be euthanized. 

Please pay your devs more so they will actually do their jobs."
482,A++,5,3/13/2021 0:47,"Easy to use, tons of music, good quality. I stream all my mixes. Only item I would love to see as an improvement is that when I use Serato DJ software live, that I could update my playlist directly from the controller without having to restart the Serato application. Perhaps that is not a SoundCloud issue however. Great app"
483,2022. Crashes every time I play a song.,2,5/29/2022 20:11,"Every time I open the app and play a song, 30-60 seconds later the music stops because the app crashes. I’ve been using SoundCloud since 2018. Why is this only happening now? I have an iPhone 12, the app is updated, and my connection is perfectly fine. It’s just SoundCloud that does this. Please fix it. It’s been happening more and more as time goes on. I see Reddit posts about this issue but no one knows how to fix it."
484,Whats happening?,2,5/28/2021 5:36,Hello I’ve been using SoundCloud for about a few good months to almost a complete by now and I’ve just recently had a problem playing music in the background while using other apps. In the past there was not a problem and played with no issue but now it just stops abruptly when I enter apps such as Instagram or IbisPaint and It was due to the newest update. Can you guys fix this pronto? Can’t not listen to music while droning on my phone and sketching.
485,Very Good App!,5,3/25/2020 21:09,"Soundcloud Is Amazing! Anyone Can Make Their Own Music And Not Have To Wait For Anyone To Accept It! And You Don’t Have To Put In Anything Extra To Sign In Just Insert Your Email, Make A Password, And Then Just Press A Button On An Email SoundCloud Sends To You And BOOM! Done. I Made One Of My First Songs, A Long Way, And I Just Had To Transfer It From GarageBand!
Amazing App, 5 Out Of 5 Stars"
486,SoundCloud,3,1/31/2021 16:49,"I love your app and I use it daily. It’s my favorite music app of all time, but I’m having a bit of a problem. After a day, it starts saying no internet connection even though I have full bars. The only way to get it to work again is to restart my phone. And when I do that, the app glitches for 30 minutes before it will work properly again. Can you fix it please? I really love your app."
487,Ok but can improve,4,1/1/2021 5:37,The app is pretty good. I just wish there was a little more variety of downloading songs without having to use the premium. Along with some way to organize your songs so that you don’t have to go and unlike and re-like your songs to get them in a specific order. Besides that problem the app is pretty good. Please help!!
488,Can’t create account,3,11/9/2020 15:09,"Hi I downloaded the app and can’t create an account. It says can’t connect to server. My phone is updated. Can you help? Not having any other issues only with this app. I also wanted to add it shows that this app is using my Apple ID in my settings. I’ve never made an account before. I had partially started making an account and it said can’t connect to the server first then it said this is spam. 
Thanks"
489,Cant just enjoy a couple songs.,1,11/8/2020 23:13,This app used to be my go to but I’m now deleting it because I cant listen to music. After every song there’s anywhere from 2 to three ads that are each around a minute long. Don’t waste your time with this app because your listening to more ads then you are listening to music also each time your on the app it pops up a video ad and if you try to go to another app it will turn your music off in general. Just don’t bother. There are many better apps.
490,please fix the GO+ glitch,4,7/9/2020 9:14,"soundcloud is an AMAZING app but i can’t listen to my songs that WERE free but now the songs aren’t and it turned almost ALL of my free so songs to GO+ and it makes me SO mad because it was mainly my favorite songs out of the play list that was turned to GO+, please fix that glitch because it’s not really fair to people who are broke and can’t afford to pay for songs that were free before."
491,SoundCloud Review,4,6/9/2020 19:55,"Let me start with the pros first. so first of all i love this app because you can listen to music off the app and it was EXACTLY what i needed. Also it has every song. but, you guessed it, their is the SoundCloudGo thing. all of my favorite songs are SCG. so i have to listen to the nightcore version which isn’t to bad but i’d rather listen to the original song. i hope they at least take that off some songs"
492,Half my music gone due to SoundCloud Go+,1,4/5/2020 6:15,"All my music on my playlist I have (which includes 202 tracks) has been cut in half by all the songs being added to SoundCloud Go+. No warning, no nothing. Just switched one day. SoundCloud, you guys really need to think about your population who can’t pay for that stuff. Especially being in this virus era of the world right now that’s just unfair. Making everyone pay for music when there are soooo many companies doing the exact opposite of what you guys are doing. This just tells me you guys care about money more than listeners."
493,it’s alright,4,3/11/2020 0:51,"been making music for about 5-6 years and soundcloud is the main place i put my music. 
i love using it and getting around it and there’s a few things i don’t like about it

1) the ads, some of em are just straight up annoying

2) the limit, if you make mixes or podcasts then your upload limit is tight compared to dropping like 50-60 songs max

3) i feel like the quality is a tad low and it could be updated but that’s just personal preference

and 4) tfw no dark mode

otherwise this is one hell of an app and i love it, the community on the other hand not so much. would like a lot less “yo i’m a 14 year old producer from atlanta let’s F4F and peep my new track” and bots but you can’t do much about those"
494,Alright,3,3/7/2020 15:00,About every 2 weeks it changes all my music to premium for about another 2 weeks. I’ve used SoundCloud for around 3-4 years and the fact they are doin this to me is just sad. I just want to listen to music Bc I can’t stand listening to kids at my school. But they just decide to pull this! I’ve been a loyal customer and even bought premium for a few months. They still do this. If it’s not fixed I’m just gonna delete the app. It’s so annoying
495,Good BUT ONE BIG PROBLEM,4,2/25/2020 22:20,"I like everything about SoundCloud. Like, honestly it’s a great app. It has a big problem though. If you don’t pay for SoundCloud Go+ you can’t have unlimited music so to speak. When you go over the time limit for listening for free you have to buy SoundCloud Go+ which I’m a freshman. I don’t make money and no way are my parents going to buy me SoundCloud Go+. So I would like this issue to be addressed. Thank you Devs"
496,Great but..,5,6/13/2022 14:41,"That app is great overall but I recently started having issues such as music not playing or “oops.. something went wrong.” I haven’t had a problem with it till now. I also have Go+ but none of my albums seem to be loading, could it be my account? Should I be worried?"
497,Trashcloud,1,7/8/2022 21:01,"Will close itself at any point in a song, will start the song 30sec+ previous from where you were when trashcloud closed itself. Processing takes forever, I have restarted my phone, closed the app and now deleted and redownloaded it because a song wouldn’t play with full LTE, WiFi, and both. Trashcloud is good for a range of genres and the majority of what a listener wants being free, with adds that either never happen or happen after every other song. You get what you pay for I guess."
498,So Far So Good,5,10/1/2021 23:03,"Just started listening; therefore this might be a bit premature or disingenuous, nevertheless, the graphics are fresh and the choices seem Varied enough to keep one listening for an extended period…I’ll give it a fair share of attention; however, if there are sneaky catches along the way I’ll definitely reevaluate my critque…"
499,In regards to the new UI Update,1,6/11/2022 21:08,"As someone whos had soundcloud on their phone for nearly a decade, this is by far the worst UI update ive seen. Icons and titles are 2 to 3 times as large now. I have playlists with hundreds of songs on them, and when scrolling fast through them in previous updates, it would slightly lag. Now i have to scroll even more due to the size of title cards, and it lags even worse due to the “hd” nature of the song art. 

Please revert to small format or just make the large format an option."
500,One thing is missing,4,6/8/2022 17:47,"One thing is missing and it's when you are in your likes tracks. When you search for something within your liked tracks.
For example I search for Bad Bunny in my liked tracks, all the bad bunny songs that I have liked pops up. I should be able to shuffle only those liked bad bunny songs."
501,A bug maybe,5,8/14/2021 1:54,Whenever i unlike a song that's deleted or that you can't listen too it doesn't get taken of my liked songs it just goes back to the top and usually i have to delete the app and reinstall it to get the song off my likes songs as i am doing rn
502,It’s OK but you have an issue,4,6/23/2021 23:54,So this just happened I don’t know if I just need to wait it out I tried turning off my phone I try to see if there was an update but for some reason when I try to like a song it will unlike instead of staying like and it’s weird and I don’t know if it’s something wrong with my phone or if my phone needs to update
503,Not working like it use to,2,7/6/2021 16:47,"I really only use SoundCloud as my form of music playing because I could listen to music while being in another app. However I go to listen to some music today and whenever I go into a different app, the music suddenly stops. And it’s done this on numerous songs, I’ve uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and it is still doing this. Not sure if it is a bug issue, but highly upset & like like it to go back to the old version Please."
504,Great but...,4,3/14/2021 13:40,I’ve had SoundCloud for quite awhile and It’s a good app easy to navigate not a lot of problems but I hate that when you search a song and play it it forces you to listen to a Stanton instead of just playing whatever the next song under it is there is a whole stations tab and if I wanted to listen to a station I would
505,Ads,3,4/9/2021 17:10,"The app within itself is a good platform for users to stream free music. However it is quite evident that SoundCloud has moved in the direction of a profit driven agenda. That is not an issue however it is quite obvious the changes they have made, after every first song you listen to it is followed by an ad, ad’s overall account for maybe half of my listening time. Disappointed in you SoundCloud."
506,Xbox problem and a subscription opinion,4,8/12/2020 6:58,"Soundcloud is amazing but on Xbox it plays like 6 songs max and then closes and I don’t know what happening so try and fix that and also instead of maki nag SoundCloud go+ so expensive just to listen to  preview music, maybe you should make a subscription that’s $8 -$10 that would allow things from the 5.99 subscription with access to all music"
507,Decent,3,12/5/2020 23:36,I use this App everyday and there has always been minor bugs like playlist images changing on some menus not not others. But after the new update yesterday it seems to close itself out randomly when playing a song. It doesn’t happen often but enough to really question what bugs did they fix exactly and how long is gonna take to fix this one?
508,Love it but...,4,1/23/2020 14:13,"I been having soundcloud for years , i remember there use to be not that many ads , then they started adding some but after 15 seconds of listening to it you could skip it, now literally you get ads like every 2 or 3 songs and you can’t even skip the ads you have to listen to all 30 seconds of it. which is kind of really annoying"
509,New glitch songs are missing,5,9/2/2022 0:59,I’ve been contacted by a friend that songs were missing and some of my own songs are missing and some for my other favorite artist please fix or SoundCloud will be ruined I don’t know if this is a glitch that also occurs on desktop
510,SoundCloud,4,8/31/2022 10:03,This is my first app review.  I love the fact that I can listen to nearly any song. The only problem I have with SoundCloud is the fact that If I’m listening to a song and I have repeat enabled and I change the song the song will play once and it won’t repeat. But other than that this app is now my most used music app.
511,It’s good.. but,4,4/13/2021 5:06,"It’s pretty good except for 2 things my
First thing is there are way too many adds like two songs will go by and then there is two 30-40 seconds non skippable adds and my second thing is that sometimes when your trying to listen to a song by a certain artist you have to have “ soundclound premium”"
512,BUGGED.,1,9/10/2021 11:54,"I continuously delete this app from my phone, and it doesn’t even go away. It still says “Open” as if the app’s still downloaded so it’s LITERALLY not even deleting from my iPhone. It’s taking up space, preventing me from doing what I need to do. Fix this immediately. Also, I don’t think that the app should STILL BE THERE IF I DELETED IT FROM MY PHONE. I reset my from numerous times yesterday and the same thing just keeps happening. It won’t even give me access to open the app, it’s just a net-like graph substituting the actual face of the app. Fix this crap."
513,Good app with some minor complaints,4,4/8/2021 16:39,"Why are there so many steps to do simple things. Love the app for the most part keeps track of what you listen to, user friendly, except for editing playlists it’s not intuitive. Very minor concern overall. It would also be nice if the recent listens and current song would sync between devices."
514,Get it together,4,12/8/2020 2:37,"Need a better way to optimize when scrolling through playlist or latest tracks especially when the playlist has hundreds of songs. 
I’m scrolling deep through an artist latest tracks and the app gets laggy and gets to the point where I can’t press the option to add songs to playlist."
515,Shuffle,4,11/4/2020 22:35,"You need to fix the way sound cloud shuffles on Xbox it just plays songs I recently added it should be the whole playlist and I have more than 1,000 songs and I just like a more better verity but I love the app but it does bug on my phone maybe just because it has a lot of songs but overall the app is amazing 10/10"
516,Lag,3,11/3/2020 13:44,"I have used this app for a very long time, but the lagging is horrible. I go to my liked songs and I try to scroll and it glitches and lags. I have anger issues and this makes me want to throw my phone. And the adds, why are there so many adds? After 3 songs I get an add about vaping or smoking, and it’s irrelevant and irritating to me. Please fix the lag if you can.. it would be 5 but I have to rate 3 from this issue."
517,A few bugs but overall it’s alright!! ^^,3,10/22/2020 0:10,Great app! I use this all the time to listen to music but there’s this problems I had recently. The ads are too long and so wish I could just skip it  henever a song plays the song would pause at random times even though I’m not doing anything. Another bug I’ve had was that the song would skip in the middle of playing a song.
518,"Love SoundCloud, awful app",2,8/22/2020 21:53,"I’ve never written a review but I felt so inclined to after how frustrated this app has left me. I love SoundCloud and I love the way the app is set up, however the app freezes so often and closes out the first time I open it up every time. I get so angry trying to scroll thru my recommended songs or trying to find new songs when the entire screen freezes every 5 seconds. Even after updating, it still freezes the same. This has been going on for so long, come on SoundCloud."
519,"Its great, but",5,5/20/2020 16:20,"I really like this app, and I’ve used it for a long time. This is kinda weird, but I was wondering if you could have a function showing what email you used? Because back when I made the account, I didn’t want to use a real email for safety reasons, but I’ve forgotten it now.... So it’s a dumb request but I hope you guys will consider it"
520,Loading Error,3,8/13/2020 17:30,Lately I have been having issues with the app. It starts off working well and halfway through a track it stops playing and then I will get a loading error message. I had been using SoundCloud with no issues for years and these past few weeks I have been having issues. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times with no fix. Please let me know if I have to do something else.
521,Love the app but it freezes,4,7/22/2020 2:45,"The app is amazing and I love it.  It’s easy for me to find audios I want to use for my edits and just to listen to, but when I go through audios it freezes and it’s stuck for like 30 seconds. I turn on and off my phone multiple times and check my WiFi but everything is fine so I don’t understand what the problem is. If it’s a bug can you fix it?"
522,Good but,5,5/5/2020 8:03,I said back in 2017 to add dark mode and they did so I think they should add an option to have multiple songs on repeat like 3 sounds on repeat like the button on the bottom or more like 10 15 or something like that because I want to Sleep but have 3 songs on repeat and I think people would like it as well
523,Amazing music!!,5,8/15/2022 3:37,"The many artists that produce on sound cloud have such an imagination and should be producing for radio if the major corporations would let them. For now I will continue listening and giving likes, join the sound cloud community for the best mix experience. Thanks to all composers!"
524,SoundCloud,5,7/10/2022 22:49,"Great Quality , You can upload and listen to music anytime and me and my friends love it. We feel SoundCloud will be a great thing to anyone and anything in the future , To the Creators .. Keep up the good work , I will always use soundcloud to upload and share content to others .. I love it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
525,Good but…,5,9/24/2021 15:42,It’s a really good app it’s better then having to pay for Apple Music but after ads we should be able to pick a song because the song after an ad is not always one we know or one that is a song we wanted to play and or listen to
526,lots of things not working.,3,6/13/2022 17:10,"home page is not loading, along with other things, . like the ""streaming section"" and like other things arent loading keeps saying now working   and certain songs are t playing and i like updated it thinkingit was cuz meeded update but still like not loading idk if its just me but i saw someone else say  smth idk. IDK! its ok like CERTAIN songs are playing but still  like   :[ work on this asap idfk"
527,Unfortunate removal of the clear history button on mobile,4,2/4/2022 2:39,"The app was great, the universe was in balance, until they removed the clear history button on the app. The patch notes have no information on this, so it would be five stars if the clear history button was re-added to the user interface"
528,Used to be good,3,12/20/2021 17:44,"Used to use this app on a daily basis. Maybe had 2-3 ads all day. Now, you will get an ad, maybe two, after pretty much every song. To add insult to injury, they dont just pass through. Soundcloud literally pauses your music and forces you to open the app and WATCH the ad. Are you kidding?? If youre struggling that bad, just go ahead and pull this from the app store. save us the headache of being reminded of how good this app used to be"
529,offline,1,11/14/2021 22:01,"i’ve used soundcloud for many many years and it’s been totally fine but recently the soundcloud app doesn’t let me play my music with no wi-fi ( which usually it does if you load it before) and i’ve tried everything and searched everywhere why and the only 
solution was to buy the soundcloud go which i will not be doing. I’ve asked friends if theirs are doing the same and they said it’s working fine, i’ve even tried downloading again and updating. Nothing has worked so far"
530,Just a small problem 😅😅,5,3/12/2021 3:53,So some of the buttons when I press on them they don’t work for some reason like for example if I go to check my history to listen to a song I’ve listened to but forgot the name and have it there the button doesn’t work
531,songs getting removed,4,6/3/2021 5:02,This app pretty much is a 5/5 but why I did pit a 4/5 is because when songs you liked get copyrighted or something it doesn’t let my know like audiomack does which who rlly help peopl because they use sc more and informing me that a songs got removed would be awesome and make this  app more special and stream more music using this app .
532,Cant post at all,1,5/31/2021 22:00,"I give this app a 1 star until you guys fix the fact that I can’t post no music, I even deleted my top songs for the reason being that it said I couldn’t post no more and to “check account details” this is getting annoying it has been about a year since I’ve been able to post a song and I am very disappointed that I lost out on views and likes... my rate will remain the same until my issue is fixed, and yes I have tried contacting you guys and visiting your useless help page...."
533,GREAT OVERALL!!!! but maybe something could help.......,5,2/26/2021 18:44,"What’s up developers, I’ve been listening to music SoundCloud for a while, But every time my playlist ends it plays random music afterwards, maybe you could add a repeat playlist button that allows a listener to loop there playlist. Thanks for you time. :)"
534,Best app,5,1/25/2021 20:23,"Some people might think I’m some bot reviewing for a weird reason, but lemme tell you right now.. it’s the best app, the ads really aren’t a problem, the music is actually the best depending on if it’s available lol but anyways it doesn’t block you from listening unless you pay like some other apps 💁🏽‍♀️💅🏽😌"
535,Unavoidable and annoying bugs,3,2/8/2021 15:18,"There is a particular bug where an artist will relate a profile and the song will still be there, just says unavailable and when you try to unadd it it gets added right back to the playlist because it’s broken. Super annoying and if you’re having people like me pay for this it shouldn’t be mad technical problems with it"
536,LOVE IT!,5,11/8/2020 20:44,"Not only is it a good way to practice on your sound, but it also gives you a chance to be heard whether it goes viral or not. If you got nobody to talk to, talk to the mic, don’t matter the quality of the sound, and if you want to make a living from music, you gotta start somewhere.. HIGHLY recommend it."
537,App needs fixing,3,1/23/2021 4:13,"Love this app & i can deal with the multiple random ads, but there's too many bugs that need fixing smh. I can't delete some songs completely from my likes. They'll come back up which is strange.. Some of my playlists are duplicated which is somewhat annoying. Also  the app lags alot when you want to scroll through songs. Could be a way better music app."
538,"Love it, but...",4,12/14/2020 19:18,"Okay, I love this app. I can listen to my music whenever I want and I like it. My only problem is the ads. There’s so many. I would be listening to soft music at night and then I’m awakened by an ad. I just want to listen to my music in peace. And I don’t want to get premium either because of many reasons. Just tone down the ads a bit and I’ll be thankful."
539,Holy Spirits,5,7/19/2020 20:52,"Holy.....EVERYTHING!  This is the best podcast ever. So original, fresh, fun and flawlessly presented. And I actually learned something. At last the Bible...and the people in it...makes sense. I can't wait until the next wild ride. Mike, Heather and Tara...I wish I could buy a round...many thanks. (Actually, I most love being welcomed into your world...let's just say as a ""senior"" I crave your courageous conversation.)"
540,Sound cloud,5,3/6/2020 10:24,It’s a good app you can trust you can also listen offline the sound with headphones or AirPods it’s also great and I highly recommend this for every one and also it’s better then other music apps when it comes to ads so yea I hope you get this app and good listening to you( :
541,Uploading my Songs,1,2/24/2020 4:53,"Look, I am a music producer. I create and upload made music from Music maker jam. But then now you guys have this thing of going PRO ,to pay every month .Which I Strongly disagree with and, I don’t have the time nor money to be doing this. It’s just unfair for those who used to be able to upload music on SoundCloud anytime , but now it’s just coming out of our pockets to upload. I am strongly Dissatisfied with this, Please Remove this, or atleast fix it. I would like to continue uploading my music on SoundCloud with no fee."
542,My favorite app of all time,5,3/12/2022 17:48,Without this app I wouldn’t have found the many relatively small but extremely talented artists that I listen to on a daily. I highly recommend if you’re looking for new music to listen to but you have to be open and receptive to a world of sounds.
543,WHY IS THIS HAPPENING,1,9/2/2022 0:33,"So like all of a sudden all the songs in my playlist and liked songs are deleted from them. And I updated the app thinking it was that and it’s still doing it. I even restarted my phone to see if that would work and nothing is working. I can’t see any liked songs or anything in my playlist. It says the I have 400+ songs but it’s not showing anything but the “let’s search” thingy. And the search bar isn’t working either and not showing me all the tracks, playlists and etc. 🥺"
544,Great! But what’s going on?,5,7/31/2021 15:16,"I really enjoy the SoundCloud app and having access to so many different tracks! However I am not sure why I keep getting loading errors when trying to play new tracks? It is not an internet/wifi issue, so I’m not sure what the issue is?"
545,I love it,5,7/8/2021 15:19,I have been loving this app ever since it came out I love listening to music in this is the perfect app that I can use when I do not have Wi-Fi please and thank you do not delete this app whatever anybody says because I know that this app is amazing and it has a lot of passion to it so thank you to the creators 💕
546,Bass equalizer??,5,11/10/2020 4:06,Can you add a bass booster templateWhere we can turn off base turn down bass and equalizer would be neat. I’m really requesting this because some older cars have old speakers. It’s like that in my car I would like more bass but the availability to be able to turn down bass or turn up bass would be a great idea. Please respond......
547,I love the app,3,1/17/2021 18:28,"But lately its been having a lot of bugs. Like when i want to add a song to a playlist, the pop up menu to choose the playlist has a little circle like its frozen on refresh. My biggest rant is that I will occasionally get an ad or two after listening to one song, or the first song i should say. That’s super annoying. The app hard resets on its own ny completely closing out."
548,It works but...,3,9/11/2020 21:39,"The app does everything fairly well except messaging. I should be able to view and respond to messages from within the mobile app. I shouldn’t be forced to leave the app, read an email that says “hey you have a message from [name of person]”, and then log onto a laptop/desktop computer in order to read the message and respond to it. Ridiculous."
549,Why did they do this?,1,5/18/2020 6:14,"I love this app, but now when you search up songs, it plays a random song instead of going down the line. This is irritation when I want to figure out which exact song I am looking for and skip to the next one, I have to open the app back up and click it myself. I may sound lazy, but I’m usually in the middle of something and don’t wanna have to stop what I’m doing to go back into the app and click it myself. It thankfully doesn’t do this when you are listening to playlists, but it still is annoying nonetheless."
550,Best app in the world,5,4/14/2022 1:37,"I’ve been using this app since 3 years now and it’s absolutely amazing. U might not get all the songs but about 80 percent of songs you will found on this app and u don’t have to pay for them, unless u want to subscribe but it let you play any songs for free. Absolutely love it"
551,Wonderful,5,6/13/2021 11:27,"One of the best app that i’ve come around up until now. It has a good collection of the high quality audio that i’ve searched of. Hadn’t found any flaws until now. So, i guess i would recommend this app the anyone who is searching for free streaming audios for their leisure time as i say. Cheers…😃"
552,Review,4,7/20/2021 2:01,SoundCloud is a great app you just have to get used to the app the one thing I liked from this app is you can control the music and skip it to your favorite part of your song and you don’t have to pay to listen to a rapper you like most of the songs are unlocked for you to listen to but unfortunately some are great app.
553,Great app,4,5/21/2021 14:08,"Great app especially for grabbing a new audience. I would give five stars, but I manage an artist who has blown up and hasn’t hit the charts yet. We’ve tagged everything correctly according to SoundCloud. I just don’t know why my artist hasn’t hit the charts yet. Hopefully this small issue gets figured out soon, if not all is well, still an all around amazing app. 💖"
554,I have a glitch,5,2/1/2021 21:39,I really enjoy the app! All the songs are free! But I had a glitch. It took away most of my likes tracks even though I never unliked them. I know it’s not the apps fault. I just hope someone can fix the glitch because it’s been happening quite a bit lately.
555,Amazing app.,5,8/17/2020 19:16,"I started using SoundCloud around when quarantine started. Now, SoundCloud’s my favorite music app. I’m listening on it right now. Getting SoundCloud Go because of how good they are (and for the features, duh). But, if you’re looking at trying SoundCloud, do it. I mean, take it from someone who constantly listens to it. Thanks for the amazing features, SoundCloud!"
556,Guwolaflare6,1,10/12/2020 20:33,"Who cares if it’s free? SoundCloud has always been free but it didn’t always have so many ads so stop making excuses for greedy tactics. You’re a part of the problem in regards to the mobile app industry. Thanks to bootlickers like you, a lot of these apps have excessive amount of ads. There’s no excuse whatsoever. Get over the fact that people are going to complain. Also, provide receipts that the artists are getting paid for these ridiculous ads. Just because they say it, it doesn’t mean it’s true you idiot. 🤦🏻‍♂️"
557,Slowly getting worse,3,9/20/2020 15:32,I’ve been using SoundCloud for a little over 6 years now. And I can understand the need for ads but there used to be one after maybe 8-10 songs and it was skip able after 15 seconds. Now listing to SoundCloud is pretty much like the radio but worse. There’s ads after every other song sometimes even 2 unskipable  ads in a row
558,"Dear Soundcloud,",3,9/18/2020 20:53,"Over the years you have slowly but gradually becoming better as an app. Can you guys make a feature where you may turn off reposts from artist/labels that you follow??? would be 4 stars but app crashes sometimes which is annoying, cool feature is the ability to download over wifi and play even without being connected to wifi or service."
559,Needs a new update,5,3/28/2020 22:35,"I’m talkin New new

You guys should have something for the songs you’ve liked , haven’t played ina while. soundcloud should be more organized with the songs & how they are , i like songs and they end up popping up at the bottom of my likes again"
560,Ad after ad after ad!!!!🤬,1,7/30/2020 5:47,"Ad after ad after ad after ad. I get that I’m not a paid subscriber but back to back 30 second ads every other song is just plain ridiculous. There’s a lot of great music I like to listen to that iTunes just doesn’t offer while I’m running and on the last minute of my run I like to go as hard as I can, but tonight while listening to music on soundcloud that last minute hit just after a song and, of course, back to back 30 second ads AGAIN! and it completely killed any motivation I had in me."
561,Autoplay,3,5/9/2020 10:14,The ability to autoplay the next search results either no longer works or was removed entirely. The inclusion of autoplaying a related track is nice but if I want to listen to the many different versions of a song I now have to have to manually go into the app and click the next song which almost always plays an ad that requires you to stay in the app and watch it to listen to the next song.
562,"It’s a really good app, but it has a problem",4,2/12/2020 23:30,I’ve been using this app since it came out basically but ever since they have updated it to fit the screen of the iPhone X (which I have) I haven’t been able to see how many comments or likes the track has. All it shows it the first number then dots if this issue could be fixed that would be great.
563,Update,3,1/14/2020 15:44,"I’ve been using the app for around 5 years. It’s reliable but still buggy, does not have an option to create queue, needs Inner-playlist search, does not have Crossfade option. Also artists’ music gets taken down then doesnt get replaced, but instead just has an “X” and says “not available,” when there should probably just be a SoundCloud go version to replace it. A bit frustrating but good app otherwise."
564,SoundCloud,5,3/28/2022 19:34,Totally recommend to all my friends and family for all music needs makes everything so much easier to organize especially with go+ have if no adds and being able to download music to listen offline. A1✅
565,new update,4,8/11/2022 6:25,"love this app and all the music provided, but since the new update you can’t shuffle a playlist? I can shuffle through my likes as much as I like, but it’s specific playlists that seem to have this issue. Please look into this, otherwise, I enjoy Soundcloud and prefer it more than other music streaming services :)"
566,New layout issues,2,6/16/2022 4:27,"According to SoundCloud I was “selected” to test out the new SoundCloud mobile layout, and it looks great imo with the exception of the extra large track icons which are a bit annoying. But ever since the change my 2020 iPhone SE has been overheating just by having the app open. I’m not sure what’s happening but I made sure to keep downloads off. If the team at SoundCloud can fix this issue I’d easily change my rating to 5 stars"
567,A.R.Periko is an artist that made me love this app,5,12/29/2021 9:03,I highly recommend that anyone using this app looks up A young rapper by the name of A.R.Periko. He has a wide variety of flavors and I know anyone that listens to his entire catalog is going to find a song that will be stuck in their head (in a good way) for longer than they’re comfortable admitting to.
568,Thank you guys for letting this app be free but like I said he probably should take down the ads,4,2/3/2022 5:39,I love you guys but one thing I don’t like is how you guys have ads are usually play music on the Music app they have no ads and you can look at the lyrics on there but I still like you guys because you have more versions of different songs
569,Intrusive redirects (good otherwise but you neeeeeed to fix this I am begging u),4,10/2/2021 15:44,"Writing this to let you know some popups on the site and the mobile app made it really hard to listen to my friend’s mix… I lost my place twice because it tried to redirect me to features I don’t use. My account is old too, it looks vaguely unintended so just submitting my feedback!"
570,Great app,4,7/20/2021 18:18,"This is a great App! I can listen to music with not that many ads, make a playlist and upload music easy! The only thing I hate is editing my playlist picture on my phone when I am on the go. There’s no way for me to change it, I even looked it up and still didn’t work. I had to google for the most simple task to do."
571,Pornhub is my favorite,3,8/2/2021 18:12,"You guys always have the best adult videos. My great grandson introduced to me to your website, and I have been watching your videos on the toilet daily since. The only thing is I have a complaint about is I don’t know how to turn down the volume of the videos. When the CNA’s come to my house to check on me, the audio makes them uncomfortable and I don’t know how to turn it off."
572,I can’t log back in.,3,1/28/2021 1:56,"Every time I try to log into my account, it’s always saying “Sorry we couldn’t sign you in. Please check that you have already created an account.” I use my Apple ID for it and I even used my email and password but it said the same thing. When I tried making a new account it said the same thing as well. All I wish to do is listen to music but I can’t."
573,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5,12/21/2020 15:14,this is the best app it barely has adds and it’s if it does it has like 10 to 15 seconds adds. But the one thing is that some of the music you have to buy premium and for a couple artists but other than that it’s awesome and you can get all your songs so⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
574,One major problem,3,12/31/2020 2:01,"I love this app I constantly use it there’s just one major problem. A few days ago, a lot of tracks have been removed from my playlists and when I try to put them back they won’t go back. I also tried making new playlists for them but they still won’t work. And the audio keeps going in and out when I leave the app."
575,Best music app,5,2/27/2022 3:24,"Tried a lot of music apps, and this is by far my favorite. Love how easy it is to build playlists, and can’t beat the music recs it gives. I’m always finding new artists, and it’s good to know my money goes to them. If you’re going to get a music app subscription, this ones the best."
576,Sharing feature broken now! Please Fix!,3,9/7/2022 3:50,Used to share music all the time. Now when I open the link it shared from friends it just takes you to the AppStore and when you choose to open the app from AppStore it goes to the homepage instead of opening the song. Disappointed it used to work flawlessly till the last two updates came out.
577,"Update is alright, however",3,6/13/2022 13:13,"Look, I really love the new UI, maybe a lot of people don't but SC has had the same UI for years now. I really appreciate the switch up. However, it does come with its many bugs. I can't listen to music or scroll down my home page because ""it looks like something went wrong, oops!"". The app, at least for me, is totally unusable right now. Any fix on this?"
578,"Bugs, Application Problems",5,10/24/2021 16:06,"So i tried to go into Soundcloud to play my music and all of a sudden it just closed, i don’t know if this is a Soundcloud Problem or my iPhone is just bad but if this is your bugs, can you guys please fix it because i can’t play anything. Thank you"
579,Some problems,4,10/5/2021 23:00,I don’t like how when you want to make a playlist or play an album if doesn’t show which songs will play next like how it used to and and it doesn’t even explain it to new users and is still confusing. But other than the constant ads it’s a decent streaming audio.
580,Pretty good over all,4,5/13/2021 14:40,I’ve been using SoundCloud for around 3 years now but this problem has just appeared. So whenever I tap the song playing at the bottom the background is really low quality. I’m not sure why this is happening but I have tried googling it’s but it just comes up with audio problems.
581,Horrible and went down hill since 2013,1,7/12/2021 9:46,Unfortunately another app that thinks WOKE crude gonna get money. This app use to be great for independent artists now it’s money hungry monster. If you don’t agree with them even as a journalist you get removed. It’s another political tool for 1% to silence others. They ads are nonstop so you’re forced to get membership. This app too has history of tracking all your internet data. AKA it spy’s on you. I highly don’t recommend it and I suggest they move to China if they want to control the narrative.
582,Awful,1,7/5/2021 2:05,"2 years ago this was my favorite app to listen to music with. The past few updates have made it almost unusable. The app freezes and lags whenever I try to scroll through any list, especially when I try to search for stuff. Music also stops at random times. People have been asking for a queue feature for years now but the developers don’t even seem to care. Sad to say that after using this app for 5 consecutive years I will now be uninstalling it"
583,Best music App,5,4/9/2021 23:01,"I love soundcloud. Out of all the other main stream music apps, SoundCloud is my favorite. I have found so many pieces of music that are wonderful, too good for words to explain. Soundcloud is my favorite place on the internet. A source of happiness and hope. Thank you soundcloud, may you live long."
584,One of the best,5,2/26/2021 22:21,Every once in a while you’ll find a new music streaming service and after a while you start to feel like it’s just not SoundCloud its doesn’t have the same community of people that make waves and create legends out of left for fall off stars
585,Needs a few fixes,4,4/6/2021 21:46,"The view count says 400, then I click on the profile and it says 4000, then goes back to 400. Also half of my reposts don’t go through. If you could fix these issues it would be greatly appreciated. I’d also love to be able to message people on SoundCloud on the mobile app. Thanks for reading this!"
586,Playing songs with out WiFi,5,7/12/2020 2:26,"Is it just me or does anyone else have a problem with playing songs with out WiFi? I app is great, don’t get me wrong but I think the app will be even better if you could play it  without WiFi. does anyone how to fix it I need help."
587,Not so great,1,1/18/2021 6:30,"Worked fine the first couple weeks I had it, it was easy to upload my tracks from GarageBand. Tried to use it to promote a single, got lots of views and followers in one day then all of a sudden it stopped showing people my music. Then I took a break and came back to it and it wouldn’t work at all. Tried deleting the app and reinstalling it and it’s like it forgot all my info. Doesn’t seem to work well on iOS for promoting music. Buggy and unreliable as it has proven to be. Would not recommend."
588,Lost stability recently?,2,11/16/2020 2:02,"I’ve noticed there seems to be a lot of input lag recently, related to having a list of tracks on the screen, either from search results or a creator. Like, when I’m viewing the search results and I try to scroll but the app simply doesn’t register my input for a minute, or if a song is playing while I’m looking at a creator’s tracks and I want to pause the song but, again, the app doesn’t respond."
589,Great app!,4,10/29/2020 21:04,"I love this app, I can skip as much as I want, and there’s barely any adds. I have been having a few issues adding songs to playlists, though. For example, I’ll add a song to my playlist. And when I check later, it won’t be there. It’s not much of a problem though. I 100% recommended getting this app."
590,Good app there’s just bots that are saying this or to many ppl are saying this,4,10/17/2020 19:51,"Soundcloud is a great app! I play everyday, everywhere, anytime even with my friends they said they liked it but there’s just i little problem ppl are saying inappropriate stuff like way inappropriate like I just deleted the app cuz I’m done seeing those go on rock edm and go to break it ok thank you"
591,This is legit the best,5,6/17/2020 4:04,This is fr better then all the other apps because you can play any song you want at any time and dont have to pay to listen any time theres a specific song and there are only a few ads and when they are there short too! 10/10 recommend
592,What the hell is going on?,2,6/29/2020 3:16,Now alll of the songs I have in my playlist are free. Now all of a sudden I need SoundCloud go+ for almost ALL OF THEM! 90% needs SoundCloud go+ CHANGE THAT! If you don’t change this problem I am simply deleting the app. There is no point in the app if most of the songs in SoundCloud are going to need SoundCloud go+ to listen to the full thing. That’s a stupid way to run your business. Change it now please. I’m not going to pay money for a song that I used to get to listen to for free. 😡
593,Soundcloud Go,3,6/4/2020 14:49,"This app could’ve been so much better if they updated the Go premium features, as a person who doesn’t have go it’s so annoying for me to listen to the ads but those are understandable, where it gets stupid is when they have certain songs under go, which tend to be more throwback mainstream songs and I think it’s very stupid that I have to go use a different app to listen to various songs"
594,foie gras goose app,1,5/13/2020 14:44,"The only reason I downloaded the mobile app is because SoundCloud makes it close to impossible to navigate through a mobile browser.

The app itself is clunky to navigate because it doesn’t have the same category menu as the desktop browser version. 

To make matters worse, it forced a song I never asked for, searched for, or care for right after one of my tracks. And there is NO WAY TO REMOVE IT. No wonder the darn thing has millions of plays. Every time I play one track of mine, it shoves that song right after.

On top of this, I paid for the upgrade to Pro, but the mobile app doesn’t recognize this. It only gives me the option to buy it again! 

So in short the whole SoundCloud experience is shove a bunch of things down your throat. They even get extortion wrong. You’re supposed to pay money to get harassed less."
595,Minor Complaint,1,3/14/2020 3:38,"App used to be so great. Now it costs $12 to access music you can find on Apple Music for $4/month. Also SoundCloud entirely stopped posting original versions of songs. So if you find a song you like and you search it chances are you won’t find it. On top of this none of GO+ songs come up in my search feed, which I pay for. It’s simply outrageous and after being a customer for almost 7 years I am finally deleting my subscription and my account.

New Update crashed the app and won’t boot past the loading screen."
596,App constantly freezes,1,3/7/2020 18:05,"I have been a SoundCloud user for at least two years now, and it was not until February when I started to notice that every time I go to my library to check out my playlist the app just freezes! I have not had to deal with this agonizing experience until this year, and I really loved this app. I am wondering if there is a glitch in the app or something, but I can’t give this app a good rating if I can’t even listen to my music. Please fix this error so I can just get on with my playlist of fire."
597,Ads are bad,4,1/12/2020 16:33,"I first got SoundCloud about a year ago. Back then, ads used to show up every 30 ish songs. Now, SoundCloud puts ads about every 2 songs, and they're all unskippable. If you leave the music on for a long time, the ads will slow down. However, I don't use SoundCloud for a really long time every day. I use it to listen to music for short periods of time only."
598,"My favorite music app but recent issue, please read",5,8/13/2022 4:14,"Recently, I haven’t been able to use shuffle play on playlists. I’m a SoundCloud Go user and this feature was always available to me until recently. Is shuffle now a premium+ only feature?"
599,Can no longer play songs from search bar,3,8/26/2022 17:01,Been a long time user of SoundCloud for unreleased music etc. as of recently I cannot play songs I search in the search bar and have already liked. It used to be I search the song name it pops up immediately I tap it it plays. This no longer is the case and I wish for someone to pls fix it..
600,10-Oct,5,5/9/2021 19:09,Works well and has every song you wanna vibe too like drake? There’s a playlist of his songs ready for you or you can make a playlist and even if you turn off your device you can still vibe to your musics totally recommend
601,Good but hard to sign in!!!,3,6/15/2022 2:14,I have been using this for one month but suddenly the app told me to sign in I tried so many times nothing really worked I tried singing in over a month I can’t get in otherwise it would say sorry but our robots think that your a spam account I don’t know why but I tried so many account I can’t get it to work anymore there are issues.
602,Love this app but..,4,6/12/2022 23:12,"Why the new UI change? It doesn’t look any better than the last one, and charging the heart/like color is confusing, white hearts look blank. It should’ve been kept red, or changed to orange, in order to fit SoundCloud’s color scheme.

TLDR: The new UI isn’t good looking. And please add a search bar in the Albums and Following sections already."
603,Short and to the point,3,6/8/2022 1:23,"SoundCloud is a decent music service but the ads are too frequent and have genuinely made me consider switching to another platform. An ad ever 2 songs can get old. Not to beat too hard though, it has a wide variety of music, but it should look into plagiarism issues more. Bringing it back SoundCloud has a lot of potential, just needs a review."
604,"No option to block EXPLICIT, some low quality music",1,9/22/2021 17:38,"As the top reviewer incorrectly states, the app isn't ""free"", and without the ability to hide songs, block explicit content etc., as many other apps do, it is simply not worth it.  You can't block explicit content, and it comes without warning as playlists and tracks aren't even labeled ""explicit"". Very noticeable differences in the quality of music from playlists to playlists, the volume becomes much lower in the low quality ones. Do not recommend."
605,Getting frustrated,3,8/27/2021 18:32,I love this app and have used it for at least 5 years. Although every month they cancel my subscription even tho I am a consistent paying customer. It’s deleting at least 1400 tracks of downloaded music and I’ve about had it. Don’t expect to get in touch with anyone either! Had to dispute multiple charges on my account because of this.
606,Crashing,4,7/18/2021 0:19,My SoundCloud for the past week or 2 is consistently crashing mid song and then I go back into it start a song and it crashes again I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it worked then now it’s back doing it again please fix this so I can listen to music without it crashing
607,Epicc except for...,5,3/30/2021 23:58,"There’s some kind of bug rn where I can’t edit my playlist at all. Everytime I try to move some songs around it just deletes my changes and tells me my internet connection is bad, even though I’ll be clearly connected to wifi. Plz fix! >~<"
608,I would download this anytime!!,5,1/29/2021 4:22,"Okay, this app is great but it has some minor issues mine logs me out every second & keeps lagging.  The songs (mine when I pick glitches to another song instead of what I picked)! Anyways I’d recommend this app anytime & anywhere to anyone! :) have a great weekend !"
609,Can’t click recently played music on I phone 12 pro,1,2/24/2021 17:24,"I never had an issue with SoundCloud on any other of my iPhone, it’s the simply the best music app out there!!!!!! But mannn I bought a iPhone 12 Pro and it took away the only thing it can from me!!! I do not know why ?!! But I can no longer click recently listening music at all. I click it and nothing happens I tried deleting and reinstalling the app I’ve tried restarting my phone and nothing!!! I don’t know if you guys can fix that but please do 🥺🥺👉👈"
610,Liked music wont show,5,7/14/2020 14:37,"So, I’ve noticed that some of the liked music won’t show on my playlist. For example, I’ll press the like button on a song, then for some reason the like button won’t be highlighted. I don’t know if it’s a bug but it’s an annoyance searching the song in my listen history."
611,Amazing,5,6/22/2020 4:39,"I love SoundCloud, I use it whenever I take my dogs out or just want to listen to music but the ads are ridiculous I wish they could either cut down on them or make it so we can chose what type of ad we want to hear and not having to go onto airplane mode"
612,Just one more thing?..,5,5/12/2020 8:30,"I love the app in general, don’t get me wrong. Everything is fine with it but I thought maybe a feature could be added to where you can Loop play a playlist just like a regular song. It’s something that I would love to have in my opinion. 🖤💖🖤💖"
613,Fan made music is awesome.,5,3/6/2020 9:27,"To the talented people out there. I thank you all for creating masterpieces with crossovers, remixes, covers, and instrumentals. 

I personally wish for this music to last forever somewhere in the future so that one day it would be called classical in itself. 

Might sound crazy, but would be cool to hear that happen."
614,PLEASE FIX PLAYLIST PROBLEM,4,3/25/2020 7:25,"After getting SoundCloud Go+ I abandoned all other streaming services. I love it. 

However, there is one big problem. I have several playlists in my library. Whenever I try to add music to a playlist, it only shows me my latest 9 or so playlists and doesn’t show me all of them. I don’t run into this issue on desktop. 

Otherwise would have 5 stars"
615,~SoundCloud: Why and why not~,4,2/28/2020 22:51,"Hewo readers,
So I listen to SoundCloud and I think it’s awesome! But it has flaws~

So I was thinking of this song~Let Me Fall Thomas Gresen~and I had my headphones on and I was away from my device~about 10 feet~the headphones were Bluetooth and they were NOT on my head. They were with my device! And I came back to my device, and I put them on. Wait for it~

IT WAS PLAYING THAT EXACT SONG!!!!!!!

I didn’t even have SoundCloud on!!!! It was soooooo freaky!!

Anyway~

I recommend the app, but look out for that! Thx for reading and I hope the review was helpful to you and anyone you know!

Thx,
P.S. I wanna know if that is normal so if the developers can get back to me on that, that would be awesome thx!

616,Help,3,1/20/2020 19:50,Soundcloud has been such a good platform to grow not only as an artist but also as a person who loves music and discovering new music. The app had been so good to me until my stats showed I was getting 0 likes in the last 7 days. That was not true it showed in the notifications that people were liking my music but it showed on the chart as 0 likes. Also my notifications don’t work on desktop version.
617,The Best of the Best,5,2/19/2022 20:05,This is so wonderful and extremely glad to you and your company a big thank you and 10+10 is great for everything including the best of Exhibition to your Music yes my name is Kevin Escobar and no one will say this words only me and please you have my Blessings be safe and take care your customer Kevin E
618,I love SoundCloud but...,4,6/15/2022 15:24,I’ve ran into the issue where the mobile version will close by itself. I love SoundCloud been using the app since 2014. However if this issue is not fixed I’ll have to move elsewhere. I really don’t want to but it really seems like it hasn’t been fixed for the time that I was gone (precisely a year).
619,Unapproachable level of awesome!!!!,5,1/13/2022 20:36,The level of unique music available makes sound cloud superior to all the other apps I’ve used for music. Up and coming artists and mashups are regularly available here compared to everywhere else. Thank you sound cloud
620,best music app,5,4/28/2021 3:24,"so good i love that u can see peoples comments and it makes u feel idk happy cause most apps don’t share that and being able to communicate with people who may go through similar situations as u can really have a good impact, i mainly use the app to listen to slowed songs and lots of songs that r sad so seeing comments ranting about mental health helps makes me feel appreciated. sometimes you see relatable comments for example, heart break which i’m sure would help some people. even though i haven’t gone through it u can tell they use their hearts in the comments <3."
621,SoundCloud,4,8/17/2021 4:53,"Great app for streaming tons of music, I don’t understand why they can’t add messaging to the app. Why even have messaging if not in the app ? I feel that would help the app take off even more helping artist connect with there fanbase and really changing things. But I’m sure they have a reason for not doing so. Other than that 4.5/5"
622,Fix it please,1,8/6/2021 12:17,Been using the app for years but can’t use it because it’s super laggy and can’t download my songs it randomly stops downloading and the music doesn’t load and stops everything and I have to go to the app and then it starts it skips songs I play music at work and get be getting on my phone every other song and it’s annoying and frustrating I pay for it and that’s not what I want from something I’m paying for the app used to be great but idk what happened
623,Great app,4,5/26/2021 20:38,"Personally i think you could loop your playlists, and i find it kind of annoying that you can only listen to some songs with GO+ but other than that its great. I really like the comment feature lol. I get to read what everyones thinking and sometimes i burst out laughing. I find alot of my favorite songs slowed, so thats awesome."
624,Good vibe only,5,2/24/2021 9:44,"I love music, so do you, I’ve never master a single or a beat, not even 16 bars. Sound cloud makes me feel, as in I’m part of tha process. New music new artist one day you hear a song next week you hear it hit your radio speakers, it’s that strong platform that makes it what it is."
625,The website version is a million times better,1,4/3/2021 15:08,"The app has soooo many ads. It’s like every time I click on a new song, I get a 15 second ad. If I’m listening in Safari, no ads at all whatsoever. Also, when I’m browsing around in the app, any song I click on just instantly starts playing. If I’m in Safari, I can browse around and click on things and a song won’t play until I hit the physical play button. Why use the app when the website version is just so much better?"
626,Simple Fix,4,2/14/2021 0:15,"Please fix: Your Insights for the time period ‘All’ - the play count for the current year displays 2019 instead of 2020.

Update Feb 13, 2021:
Now it’s 2021 and the play count for the period shows the current date as “2020”.  Apparently it us very difficult to get the date to be current.  Perhaps this can be fixed in time for 2022...?  
Fingers crossed"
627,Download error,1,1/17/2021 0:51,"I’m needing to update an old music app and had been searching for a good app with good reviews. I found this app and figured I’d give it a try. I downloaded it, and  had to create an account. I prefer not to give all info, so when it asked for gender, I tapped prefer not to say. I got an error message. I tried to log back in three times only to have them say there’s a server error. So I deleted the app. I didn’t even get a chance to listen or download music. So the search is back on for a new music app"
628,Wow,5,11/29/2020 12:53,"So I originally had a bad feeling about SoundCloud, especially because some bully used it for really explicit music. But, I decided to make my own beats. And whalla, I had 542 plays within the first two hours of release. I was amazed. So absolutely use this app and find a sponsor label, you’ll grow quite fast."
629,It sometimes plays out of nowhere but it’s a good app,5,11/12/2020 23:31,So I was doing something and it was completely quiet and then all of a sudden the song just came on I also close the app and it just played ends it gets really annoying but overall I think it’s a really good app
630,"Amazing, would be better with less ads",5,9/29/2020 22:01,"The app in general is amazing! A bunch of people like me my covers, making me almost famous, not many plays, anyway, maybe get rid of the spam bots and reposter bots? They really bug me, and many other artists, and maybe, just maybe, no more go+?"
631,Pretty good,5,4/12/2020 21:47,"Ive been using sound cloud for 8 years now and I've seen the way its has grown and love it. The only thing I don't like is how whenever I try to remove a song from my playlist now its crashes. Please fix this I've turned my phone all the way off, logged in and out, but it continues to crash."
632,Pretty good app,4,6/18/2020 4:04,"This is a really good music/production app. The only couple things is that the adds come on way more that they should. Also, if you post a song, within the next couple weeks or so from when you posted the song, you won’t be able to listen to some songs until you post another song. But yeah, otherwise, good app."
633,Network errors all the time - always saying offline,1,1/20/2020 22:01,"Ever since I’ve downloaded this app 5+ years ago it’s been super buggy when not on wifi. The app always throws network error at you when the network is completely fine. It always says you’re offline when using data when you’re not offline at all, and other apps are working fine. I’ve had to delete the app and re-download it to fix but lately that doesn’t even work. The developers need to test it out more and fix this bug."
634,Not working right now but good app,5,6/13/2022 16:55,The app just updated and it won’t load anything I asked my friends if they had the same problem and they did have the problem so can you please fix it because I love this app and I enjoy my daily music
635,kinda ABSURD that there’s no “repeat playlist” option in app…,4,7/19/2022 19:33,"i can’t stand the fact that before a playlist ends i have to frantically scramble to restart it or stop the last song so i don’t get JUMP SCARED by some rap track i haven’t even liked or interacted with 😭😭 PLEASE add this, it’s available on the web version, it neeeeeedssss to be added to mobile"
636,Excellent Site for Musician’s,5,10/19/2021 17:35,"Finding new indie- music, or preparing to upload my own, I find SoundCloud to be the place to go to.
I’m starting to dig into this site more now that I’m becoming more satisfied with my own music creations and productions.
Discovering new music from unsigned artists is as easy as a few clicks away."
637,Disappointed,3,11/3/2021 19:52,"Im not sure if there was an update, but I’m disappointed in SoundCloud. I listen to music all day while working. I’m in out of my car. Once I get back in I just resume whatever I was listening to. Now I have to start the mix all over again. It made listening to SoundCloud enjoyable, with this change it’s not so much anymore. If you can PLEASE keep it the way it was."
638,It’s great no problems so far,5,5/28/2021 21:41,10/10 you can post your music and start a fan base. Also there’s alot of songs you can find that you can’t find on other streaming services. Whole bunch of unreleased Juice Wrld songs so do what you want with this information.
639,Ads,1,8/30/2021 9:48,"SoundCloud founder and company. Absolutely disgusting job with the ads, two, not one, 2 ads that are 30 seconds back to back. Trying to siphon my money with SoundCloud pro? Miss the days of old when there was little to NO ads, as well as the ads that can be skipped after 15 seconds. Been listening for years, and yet y’all managed to make listening to music a strain. Money hungry, typical corporation mentality, why not instead of line your pockets, you line up some ears with music not stopped for free you shmucks."
640,Crashing and bugs,3,6/17/2021 8:41,I can’t stand the little bugs so many but other than that it’s good at the moment I’m about to board a flight and I have go + but of course the app randomly crashes while I’m in the middle of a song like every song I can’t stand it what’s the point of paying 15 a month so I can have music take up storage and not be able to listen to it smh
641,Listen Bro.....,5,3/28/2021 5:02,"This is where those who are “Not afraid to Try” place their time and art upon, You will hear those who are Good and those who are.. not so good? lol BUT!.... when you discover that ONE, Two, songs that make your spirit manifest its own existence.... you will see.... why i wrote this review here 😂🤦🏾‍♂️ and chose 5 stars..."
642,Slowness scrolling through playlist,4,4/8/2021 4:22,I have like 1000+ songs in a playlist and scrolling through it is very slow or gets stuck sometimes really wish SoundCloud would fix this issue already been SoundCloud supporting since it first came out hope they see this
643,I just got this app so I can listen to my favorite music,5,12/25/2020 2:27,"I have difficulties with my SoundCloud when I click on the like button on my favorite groups and bands it’ll say it’s oops 
it looks like something went wrong how can I fix it so I can start liking my favorite things"
644,My companion.,5,10/17/2020 20:26,"It's been 3 years I had been listening to it. I love sound cloud. Early morning bus journey to office could never be better without it. And I also did not feel alone in a late night bus. Now, it would be so great and exciting to have it on my apple watch. Possible?"
645,Sounds that Move your Soul,5,1/23/2020 13:47,"This is truly my favorite platform to find new and old music that I vibe with. I connect better with music than people in my life. In here I have found my tribe. I am able to decompress and scan beats, new drops, and even local upcoming events. Download and connect to the sounds that move your soul"
646,It’s happening again! (Bug),4,9/20/2020 20:29,Everytime when I try to like the music it keeps on unliking it so I had to spam it and it liked it and when I reopen the app it doesn’t appear on my music that I liked and when ever I unlike the music I don’t like it keeps on liking the music please fix this bug I hope you understand
647,"I love SoundCloud, but",4,8/28/2020 13:49,"I don't ever write reviews, but I use this app A LOT so I figured I'd write a review. First off, I love the variety of music on there. I've discovered sooo many artists just from browsing different tags on SC.

I’m having issues lately with it though. My app keeps shutting down on me. I’ll be listening for 10-15 mins and the app closes. Very frustrating. This isn’t the first time either"
648,I <3 it,5,8/2/2022 22:45,"I wish they kept the queue part, though :(. I liked the visual aspect of seeing the exact order in which the songs will play and having the ability to switch the order around from there."
649,Says I need SoundCloud Go + to listen to songs?,3,8/22/2022 22:13,I don’t know what happened recently but everytime I search for a song NOT through my library but through the global search feature a message pops up saying to subscribe to SoundCloud go. That hasn’t happened before and the somgs I search for are free standard songs or remixes so I’m confused. Hopefully the next update fixes this.
650,Its been years….🙄,4,5/7/2022 1:55,"Honestly I’ve had an iPhone for forever, why is it 2022 and we still aren’t we able to see our queue like for what’s playing next and get the option to re-order. I love the originality of the app itself not like most apps but like thats a necessity if you’re a music streaming platform."
651,Started noticing glitching,3,5/14/2022 1:24,"It’s a really good app, I like that you can listen to music offline as long as you don’t close the app. I recently started noticing problems with the offline music and it would start glitching and not fully playing a song, I ended up subscribing to SoundCloud go+ and the same thing was happening. I honestly am upset SoundCloud was my go to app to listen too with no worries"
652,"Neat app, but lots of bots.",4,3/6/2022 21:33,"I really like the app. I can actually upload my stuff that I make, but every time I upload my music I only get interactions with bots that promote scams. I don’t even care about the scams at this point. I just want real interaction. Like I said, it truly is a great app, but please find a way to either remove or limit the amount of bots on this app."
653,Worst music streaming app I have ever used,1,3/12/2022 3:03,"I have used SoundCloud for years, and I loved it. Up until a few weeks ago when it randomly signed me out. I normally wouldn’t mind, but it won’t let me sign back in because it thinks “the sign in looks like spam”. It says the exact same thing when I try to create a new account. I have tried creating a new account on my phone, laptop, and iPad. None have worked.

Fair warning to all who use SoundCloud:

Don’t EVER sign out. It wont let you back in. The customer support is horrible. It tells you on the help center the only way to reset your password is to sign into the account you had. If you don’t know your password, kind of defeats the whole purpose, right? 

I genuinely wonder how someone could put together an account recovery page so horribly."
654,Premium Quality but TOO MUCH ADS,4,11/24/2021 23:30,"I love soundcloud and i think it’s a good free music platform, but too many ads. I get an ad every like 2 songs, and it’s annoying. I hate getting 1 minute ads. (2 ads most times or 1 ad)
And it’s annoying whenever I want the perfect time to play music. Less ads will make the app so much perfect."
655,App,3,10/15/2021 21:10,"It’s a good app and the songs are okay but you can literally play a playlist and one song comes on and right after play a commercial and it will continue to do this and the song you can only find selected songs some they won’t have and the original version by the singer you have to pay,but overall it’s a good app you should download it😁👍🏾"
656,Great but needs just one thing,5,9/18/2021 7:22,"They need to add an add album button to playlist so you can add a whole album to any of your playlist without having to add the album song by song. That’s honestly my only complaint, but other than that its a pretty good app."
657,Sound cloud rate😜🤟🏾,5,1/28/2021 2:15,I love sound cloud because when you turn off your device the song still plays I just don’t like the ads so when I do listen to music I just vibe to the song and when my phone turns off it still plays
658,Crashes Alot Lately,4,7/31/2021 14:36,"I have been using this app for years, never had a problem. But for the last month or so, I’ve been having problems with the app crashing on me. At first randomly, then it’s right when I open it and go to a specific page to select a song. Please fix this!"
659,Do not try SoundCloud go+,1,6/21/2021 12:20,"It’s hard to find the original version a lot of the time, usually just lots and lots of amateur sounding remixes. They do not notify you to cancel before you are charged like many other companies do as a courtesy. I find this to be very shady and have no plans to use the subscription. I hope they are happy with what they got because I will not spend any more money with SoundCloud or recommend their service to anyone ever again. In fact I will do the exact opposite."
660,Great,5,6/19/2020 2:45,"Honestly, I’m just writing a review so I can stop getting this pop up. I just want to check out the music. Send these review requests to email so it’s not in our face right off the word go cause part of me wants to write a glowing review then walk away and not come back for another five years. Like I did last time."
661,I love this app,4,1/17/2021 9:40,"but theres this one problem that, when theres a new song, l like the song and it gets into the liked tracks list, but then when i open the app again, its gone, and its not even in  the og artist’s tracks anymore , while on other devices or accounts that track still exists!"
662,Not Transparent. It is not Free,1,11/17/2020 17:38,"When I got around to reading more about the site it is not free. After 7 days you have to pay. Not very transparent about this being a pay site. And their servers will not set up my account. Tried on several different lap tops and used several email accts.  that are mine. And it will not work. Does not make me feel like they want my business, nor can I trust their servers to do what they are supposed to do. I will stick with Apple Music as I trust then and it always works."
663,One of  the worst app,1,10/17/2020 7:16,I used to like soundcloud when it was new but as the time passing by they are making it worst. It used to be like anyone can post a song but then copyright thing came up in the app I would add bass or remix it and they delete my account and other people that posted same song they never deleted those now since I only use it to listen music after each song they add a 30 seconds ads that you can’t skip and they add 2 ads non skipable one song 1 ad.
664,Needs EQ,3,9/21/2020 6:10,"They really need to put in an EQ. Other than that... the platform as a whole has lost its ability to really connect you with artists, unique sounds, and help you discover crazy things. It’s way more commercial now and definitely lacks luster when it comes to the UI. Regardless of all that, I hope they never change the wave bar interface."
665,Top Tracks,3,9/5/2020 22:38,"Top tracks is very bugged. Songs with 1,000+ plays are getting shown up by tracks with less plays. And some tracks aren’t even shown that have 900-1,000 plays on my page. 
I’ve noticed this alot on other peoples pages as well, if I wasn’t a frequent user I would’ve never noticed this happening which is why I assume nobody is commenting on it.
Hope this gets fixed, great app but this needs to be solved"
666,Good App,3,7/23/2020 17:08,"This is a great open platform, but i pay for go+ and the downloaded music is gonna glitch out when i have service. i shouldn't be stuck here waiting for eternity that never ends up working unless i restart the app five times for my music that i have downloaded to play. this glitch is really ruining the app for me like why even pay if it works less than when i didn't pay for a membership."
667,THIS IS DUMBB,3,7/22/2020 18:36,"I love soundcloud and i always use it but it annoys me so much when they try and get money out of us by makin every song locked and only lettin us hear the preview just to make us pay for soundcloud go. Im about to stop using it bc they litterly are just trying to get money put of you, it last about 4 weeks where you cant even listen to songs without soundcloud go, stupid as ever."
668,Love this app but..,5,5/5/2020 21:47,"I have always been a big fan of this app. It has been a convenient source of music. However, two days ago, I have had issues with the app crashing suddenly. I believe that this is because of the new update, but I’m not too sure. Hopefully it gets fixed soon."
669,An angry user,3,6/17/2020 4:34,"I love SoundCloud and all but when it randomly looses all the songs I’ve saved out of no where pisses me off because that is the second time it has done that. I love how you can pick a song by choice instead of skipping trough a whole album for just one song until you run out of skips. This is coming straight out of my heart and soul, I really love SoundCloud but it’s just that one flaw that really pushes my buttons."
670,SoundCloud review,5,1/18/2020 11:33,"SoundCloud has been very useful and helpful so far for my hip hop career, currently in conversations with a record label to possible sign a deal. I started off on SoundCloud got a little decent fan base, until I could get on all streaming platforms. Now I could possibly have my dream come true! Always remember though, OWN YOUR MUSIC!"
671,"Without music, life would be a mistake.",5,4/21/2022 13:33,"Sound, tone we all react from a visceral level, it's a part of our DNA , vibrate high!  SoundCloud facilitates the expression of music, fills my life up with perfect sounds.  Never an issue to share with a friend, discover new exciting talent, easy experience. I use it daily!"
672,Nice but one thing I don’t like,5,1/3/2022 18:39,I love this app you get to listen to so many songs and you can listen any song just by looking it up but I don’t like the Go+ feature where you can’t listen to certain songs other than that I love this app 5/5 stars
673,User,4,4/17/2022 16:22,It’s an overall amazing app but I do have one problem and that is that there is no way to view the next up sections on iOS devices but the option to view the queue is there on other phones like my Oppo. So it would be really beneficial if there was a way to see the queue on iOS devices as well.
674,It’s a good app.. but crashes a lot,3,3/1/2022 17:36,"I really love this app, but for some reason with the recent update, it’s been crashing on me. It would work for probably 30 minutes to an hour, but then it would crash on me and I would have to open the app again and find the music I was listening to. Please fix this bug. Other than that, this app is terrific!"
675,It’s decent,3,12/13/2021 3:59,"The music is good, the only issue is really the UI and the pain of adding or removing songs from custom albums.
Oh and also 1 minute ad-breaks after every other song is very annoying. Every minute of my life wasted hearing the same terrible ad over and over again makes me want to use the product less and less.
But the music’s great, so who cares?"
676,Listened to the complaints and fixed the bug,5,7/31/2021 14:34,Many of us filed a lag and slow loading issue that was happening in our playlists and they fixed it it all loads smoothly now thank you
677,Where did all the male listener audios go??,4,9/23/2021 2:09,The app is overall great but the male listener audios made this app really special to me. I did love the male listener nsfw ones but I just want them back i don’t know if the people who posted them deleted it or you guys took them but all im asking is just bring back the male listener audios plus the nsfw ones too if you may please.
678,SoundCloud,5,2/15/2021 1:14,"I use this app so many times even when I’m taking a shower. I have my speaker playing while I’m taking a shower and it’s amazing. Btw I use my Airpods to play my favorite song over and over again, I just want to say I really love this app and I hope others will too."
679,Where is CarPlay support?,3,5/19/2021 10:46,"Hi guys, great app and stunningly beautiful.... but you know that. Not a lot has changed. The year is 2020 and there is still no support for Native CarPlay????? I dont want to fidget with my phone while driving. Please help me live a longer live and turn on CarPlay. 

Also there is no Siri integration. I cant use my voice to play something from SoundCloud 

As a paid customer please start to innovate on this app. Thanks."
680,Great app for music especially the free version,5,12/5/2020 17:25,Haven’t tried the paid version but free version has a lot of variety of music and you can select any song and play it they’re are ads but they aren’t bad and they aren’t a lot of them either
681,Great for work!,5,4/12/2020 16:55,"I, a very hard worker, recommend this song using app at you can use it during work, all you do is make a playlist and just let the songs play while working, you won’t have to change the songs of turn away as they play themselves!"
682,To many ads,4,11/5/2020 22:24,"Great music, i love the way this app works, they really put thought into it. But this app has way to many ads. I could be listening to only 1 or 2 songs and three 30 sec ads come up. Im not complaining about the ads but i think we should have more songs to play."
683,"The app is amazing, but there’s a problem.",4,7/24/2020 18:32,"The app is amazing, I’ve actually been using this app for quite some time and it’s been the best. But there’s a problem, each time I’m doing something like in my phone while listening to music. It’ll just stop playing and I have to keep pressing the play button, it’s annoying to be honest. But aside that the app is great!"
684,When will this app get fixed?,2,7/8/2020 9:36,"Love SoundCloud and all it’s done for the community, however it’s mobile app has shown poor performance for so long to the point where I feel as if it’s a lost cause. It’s been buggy and slow for a while, has the tendency to freeze practically whenever I even try to interact with the app itself. I know I’m not the only one who has this issue. Hopefully something will be done one day to fix this for good but who knows..."
685,Yo like what the hell,2,5/25/2020 9:04,I use music to help with anxiety and such as a coping mechanism but it’s not fun when your favorite music streaming service decides to make half of your playlist GO+ I really don’t know why you decide to do that also when it’s already in a playlist I used that playlist every single day of my life for the past 4 months and you cut my 3 hour playlist to a 1 hour playlist because you can’t let anyone have anything without wanting anything in return.
686,Consider this,4,2/5/2020 19:30,"I’d really appreciate if y’all could add “Add to Next Up” option on the IPhone app, too! Why don’t we have it??? I’d really really would like it, please. 
Additionally, can we have a feature where we have the option to MUTE reposts... thanks. (Many accounts I follow are great but sometimes the music they be reposting AINT. And other accounts simply repost too much and overwhelm my timeline)."
687,Songs aren’t working,3,1/11/2020 20:59,"I used to love this app but now all of a sudden some songs aren’t available when they once were or some just don’t play. Another problem is that sometimes some of my liked songs just disappear and then when I finally find them it says not liked when they once were

Pls fix this problem but other than that it’s a great app and I recommend"
688,D3 Cre8ted🌎👾,5,7/1/2022 23:41,Soundcloud ☁️has been my number 1 music streaming choice 🎵 for ages now. To date the cloud shows an expression of compassion for all of their artists who has use the worldwide platform to pursue..A special thanks to all the creators and co-creators 💕for your hand in helping the music artist of this day and age🌎🤘🏽..
689,Displeased,2,4/1/2022 8:55,"I enjoy releasing to SoundCloud regularly to the extent I purchased the premium which I later canceled, it charged me two more times after that I just ignored it maybe it was catching up on missed payments but two months after cancelling it, still it is trying to charge me $16 for something I don’t even have access to. Please please fix this otherwise I’ll have to report it as fraudulent and I really don’t want to do that"
690,What is going on???,1,6/13/2022 17:29,"So I've used this app for about 2 years now and it has worked wonderfully all the time. Though recently there was an update, and it has been giving me a lot of problems. I cant access the music or playlists i created anymore, the homepage says there was an error, and it doesn't let me do ANYTHING. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it and nothing, if anything it made it worse. I am not about to go back and like 500+ tracks worth 2 years."
691,Can’t cancel your subscription from the app,1,5/15/2022 14:20,"I downloaded the app to cancel my SoundCloud go subscription and spent several minutes only to find out you can’t cancel it from the app, which is absolutely unnecessary and predatory design. The website is garbage and hardly useable on mobile, and it made it incredibly difficult to cancel the subscription from my phone. There are many services out there that are so much better than this, it’s really not worth your time."
692,SoundCloud,5,7/18/2021 1:25,"Honestly a really good app, everything runs great, when you add a song to a playlist it automatically downloads it if you have premium, really good for underground artists and leaked songs 👀👀 definitely the best music app though highly recommend"
693,DONT GET ME WRONG 🧛🏻‍♀️,4,1/3/2022 9:03,"This app is great but some songs that I like aren’t using available or I can’t find on the app or you have to pay to listen to it which I can’t pay for because I’m broke and it’s sometimes is really annoying but besides that the app is great !!!! 

Sorry for my spelling or punctuation English isn’t my first language!!!!!

🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐"
694,Love this app but this is stupid,1,10/7/2021 13:58,The app is nice but it would be a lot nicer if I wasn’t forced to listen to two 30 second ads after every 2 songs. There’s no reason ads should be that frequent. I’ll get on the app and play one song and then an ad will pop up😐. There’s nothing that says “we can’t manage our app” louder than constant ads after every few songs. Make some changes cause I know that I’m not the only one who thinks these constant ads are annoying .
695,Very good but a couple issues,2,8/12/2021 3:13,"I’ve been using sound cloud sense the beginning of 2020 and it worked pretty well until now, lately it hasn’t been letting me play songs… it’s updated but the songs always pause for some reason and that’s never been an issue for me before. I would even listen to songs with no wifi or data but now it won’t let me play music with or without wifi."
696,I love the music,5,4/24/2021 5:13,SoundCloud had been a staple for me releasing my music over the years. I think the music culture appreciates SoundCloud for allowing us to share our music with the word and the online community is very supportive and willing to listen. Can’t say enough good things about it
697,Review for SoundCloud,5,4/23/2021 2:02,"I have been using sound cloud since I could remember , best music , never had a problem with the app best app ever I would recommend to everybody I know and everybody else. Best music Ever . I don’t think I’ll ever use any other app . You can use it online and offline."
698,Really good app,5,9/26/2020 5:38,Soundcloud is a good app but I have two problems number one the ads they take too long number two since I’m using an iPhone I’m not aloud to set up a song for an alarm or ask Siri to turn on music unless I pay for a membership with $9.99.
699,Loading error,1,9/26/2020 21:16,"I would like to point an issue out so that the app can be updated.

There is a bug in the system where the tracks I listen to cannot be played. Rather, something comes up where it says “Loading error, tap to try again.” No matter how many times I reload the song, turn off my phone and turn it back on again, refresh the app, or any troubleshooting mechanism. It doesn’t work.

Please fix this as soon as possible. Thank you."
700,Awesome but way to many adds,5,6/22/2020 3:56,As and editor I usually use SoundCloud to find audios but it’s hard because I’m constantly getting adds after adds and it’s always the same one. And it gets annoying like I literally have the whole add stuck in my that’s how many times I’ve heard it.
701,Love the app,5,6/9/2020 2:37,Just wish it didn’t have an upload limit because as a 15 yr old upcoming rapper I tend to make a lot of music and often have to delete less played songs to upload more because I can’t pay for SoundCloud go
702,Keep the music alive!,5,5/30/2020 4:31,"Incredible tool for independent artists and to find independent artists. Great database of music. A little hard to find what you’re looking for when you don’t know exactly what it is (unlike Spotify’s discover tools and algorithms), but it has gotten better. Worth the price to support music around the world."
703,I mean... It’s not terrible,4,6/4/2020 21:46,"It’s alright and everything but I have two complaints, 1st one: Long ads

I was fine with ads that were about 15 seconds and were skippable, now they are same ads over and over and most of them are not skippable and it takes 30 seconds for the ad to go away. Please make them a little shorter and skippable, thanks.

2nd complaint: The iPhone version of this app does NOT let you read descriptions, while you can MAKE them but not read them; Which I thought was stupid, so please let the iPhone version read the descriptions, thank you! 

Anyway, besides those two things, the rest is great! Hope you read this!"
704,Best Music App To Exist,5,2/10/2020 21:54,"SoundCloud is better than the other music apps because you can play whatever song that you want, released and unreleased, and you don’t need internet to use it. You can turn your phone off and you don’t need to pay for a membership to get that feature."
705,Preparing to upload?,5,6/18/2022 5:12,This is a great app to use but everytime I try to post my music it keeps saying preparing to upload and I updated the app to the newest one and it still says it I checked everything and it keeps saying preparing to upload idk why I need help lol
706,Love The App,4,7/22/2022 16:14,"It’s how I listen to most of my unreleased music that I like, lately I’ve been having this weird issue and Everytime I close my iPhone or go to another app the music will stop playing and the app will just completely restart. Any tips how to fix so I’m not forced to keep my phone on while I listen to music."
707,Song History,4,6/27/2022 8:15,"To keep it brief, maybe it would be nice to maybe add a feature to where we can just remove one song from our song history and not the history itself? It would be a good feature to add, as this will give good thoughts to the users of the app"
708,Great App,5,5/19/2022 0:13,One thing i recommend to add is a search bar on playlists i have so many songs in one playlist sometimes i have trouble looking for a specific song! overall been using soundcloud for 6 years
709,I Love SoundCloud,5,1/29/2022 17:56,I like the way the music is displayed and the way it sound. I also noticed that there is a graph also for how the music is play and there is more that one version of the song in which gives a different point of view. Thank You! KAFORREAL
710,Awesome!,5,3/21/2021 21:55,"Sound cloud is great it also gives you access to listen to music while on a other app such as if your working or taking a shower or anything,you will have access to listen to muscle with your phone on or off!!"
711,Truely love soundcloud,5,12/5/2020 6:34,I actually have an audience that follows my music on soundcloud. No other app gets the same feedback or comments on my tracks. Its just all about music and sharing new songs to people that have a similar ear and love to enjoy a well established playlist.
712,Amazing,5,12/4/2020 13:22,The app is amazing keep making updates to the app and fixing bugs and making the sound quality better I love this app but how about some app redesign to make the app and maneuvering through the app better but all in all Good work keep it up
713,Love this app but wish I could rearrange my songs,4,7/18/2020 1:10,So I’ve been using SoundCloud for about 2-3 years now and I LOVE it. But I really wish I could change the order of my songs in my library without having to remove songs and readd them to my library. It’s very annoying. I hope they PLEASE update the app and put that in. Other then that it’s a great app and I love it.
714,Too many ads you can’t skip anymore,1,10/24/2020 2:59,I have used SoundCloud for years but decided to delete recently due to the tremendous amount of ads. They used to let you skip them after 5 seconds but not anymore plus I can’t switch to a new song at all without atleast 1-2 30 second ads popping up. I have 2 friends who have deleted this app bc of the continuous ads. I love how many types of music are readily available but the constant commercials are ridiculous.
715,bruh SoundCloud Go+,1,5/17/2020 3:33,"I don’t really like that NOW almost every song on the app is only for SoundCloud Go+ users, I’ve been using the app for about a year and a half, before this, it hasn’t been an issue, I get the ads, that’s fine, but almost every song I like, you have to have GO+ to play it, I would rather have A LOT more ads other than most of the songs having to play with a subscription. Thanks to this, I will not be using SoundCloud until further notice."
716,There’s a problem,5,3/21/2020 17:01,When I started using sound cloud most of the songs are free but today I logged in and almost of the songs are premium and this never happened before and when I signed into my other account most songs were free
717,IP address issue,2,5/9/2020 5:54,"So after working flawlessly, I’ve noticed every few months that the app would not let you sign in with a no network message and asking you to try again. Ive searched answers to this and many many people have had the same issue which is frustrating. One solution that I read, which has worked for me, was to download a VPN and use it. Only then am I able to use Soundcloud and log in. That is ridiculous."
718,good but bugs,4,3/30/2020 0:47,"I love using soundcloud but theres this bug that is starting to annoy me. Whenever I create a playlist and its public it always duplicates I don't know why but it does this and it starting to annoy me because it will take up space as if it is a separate playlist, making it take forever to scroll down to a playlist I wanna add a song too."
719,Compatibility with Siri,5,2/4/2020 13:56,"Everything is perfect and stuff but, everytime I want to play something I always need to find it instead of asking Siri. It would be lovely and a dream if you add this feauture, it provides productivity without having to struggle looking for the song your looking for to play. Thank you!"
720,The best place to listen to songs,5,5/30/2022 5:30,You can find any song you want to listen to and they keep them for you and it’s just the best app when you’re traveling it works when you’re going anywhere it works it’s the best.
721,Pay for a working search bar?,1,8/27/2022 15:58,I just opened SoundCloud to see you have to pay for a working search bar what a joke I don’t understand the point in taking away a basic feature that makes searching for songs completely monotonous now actually it’s pretty obvious SoundCloud just wants your money for their subscription and don’t care at all about user experience or quality of life users expect its pathetic SoundCloud would stoop this low
722,Use to be good,1,8/3/2022 7:40,I use to use SoundCloud a lot looks like they became greedy because I come back years later to half of my songs on my playlist being locked behind a premium pay wall really? Now I can’t even listen to my favorite artists without paying a monthly fee get outta here so ridiculous the only songs you leave available to Listen to are crappy remixes made by random people all the good music you put behind the SoundCloud go feature unbelievable.
723,Is it only me?,3,7/6/2022 0:48,"It has worked really well for me, but a few months ago its started working worse on my phone. It kicks me out of the app when I've turnt off my phone, which should work. This worsens when it’s on loop. 

It’s also been having some loading struggles lately.

Again, i don’t know if this is only my phone, but it really bothers me."
724,Love SoundCloud but…,3,7/4/2022 8:41,I would like to start by saying I been a SoundCloud fan since early 2000’s… I’ve been listening to my music and then the app will cut out and stop completely on its own and refresh. I have to go back into the app and restart the song over to where I’m cleaning or going for a run and want to just delete the app now because of this inconvenience.
725,Decent,4,12/11/2021 23:07,It’s okay I guess but it could have better playlist organization like another person said and I keep having this bug recently a lot where it keeps crashing and I just have to redownload the app it’s just pretty annoying I mainly use the app because of the variety
726,Listen offline,4,3/19/2021 21:24,"When I first got the app it was great and I would be able to listen offline with no problems, but recently it hasn’t been working and this was the only app that I could find that would let me listen offline but now it’s just like the others, really a turndown for me!
;("
727,Can’t record,2,2/16/2021 10:41,I just used this app just a couple months ago to record but now the record button is gone. I checked in every setting page and nothing. Idk what happened to this app but this is dumb. And if I have to pay monthly to record then you can see me use something else. I’ve used this app for several years now and this is the first encounter I had with this. Shouldn’t ever happen
728,"Great, but needs a way to hide comments",4,1/27/2021 14:51,"I love this app and use it all the time, but when I’m playing a song It really bothers me to see comments pop up and ruin the experience of the music. Please enable a way for comments to be hidden while music is playing without me having to pay an arm and a leg."
729,Some songs won’t load,4,12/14/2020 21:25,Recently have had issues with loading a song I want to play it says error tap to try again and that’s it I can’t hear the song anymore but I know it haven’t been removed please help I use iPhone 7 it’s a bummer really because I pay for no ads
730,great to see soundcloud improving,5,6/18/2022 7:12,"so glad to write this review, this app has definitely improved crazy over time, im glad to be witnessing this and can’t wait to see the next big great things to come for soundcloud in the future! stay Blessed"
731,New update is great but…,4,7/6/2022 17:38,"I love this new update for July 2022. The UI is awesome, however it’s been years and SoundCloud still hasn’t been integrated with Apple CarPlay. It’s such a shame, I know audio still works but I don’t want to pick up my phone while driving to change what I’m listening to. Why haven’t the devs made a CarPlay app?"
732,Great App but…,5,4/24/2022 14:06,"Great app and music selection, but not being able to rearrange your playlists is a big issue. I don’t want to be forever scrolling through playlists in the order they are created. Please fix, otherwise, excellent!!!"
733,Good app except one thing,5,10/24/2021 2:58,The SoundCloud app is really good it’s just that ad’s get more annoying frequently I’ve had it for about 1 and a half years now and if I think of it and I can see all of the little and big changes happening
734,All Love!,5,6/15/2021 21:35,I’ve always loved this app. The best part is how anyone can upload music so everyone can share art and enjoy it together. Most apps only put the big people on top or just in the relevant search. That drives me crazy because I love finding new music.
735,Brilliant Music Platform / Creation,5,1/17/2021 18:13,"Without a doubt, SoundCloud has made a significant improvement in my overall health and welfare in terms of my struggle. Listening to the different types of music has allowed me to have a different perspective and has been an integral element in my life."
736,Horrible interface,1,5/18/2021 1:28,"I’ve used this app on and off for almost 5 years now and the interface on this app is the entire reason why I switched off of it. It lags whenever you scroll down, your playlists get lumped in together with albums you’ve downloaded so good luck finding them… and overall the UI on this app would be inferior even back in 2010

This app would’ve been an easy indisputable 5 stars if you just overhauled the interface on iOS."
737,Bug?,3,4/1/2021 19:17,I’ve had this app for a few years and it’s been great I was just using it yesterday and when I went on the app today none of my music will play I deleted and powered my phone off and I hope this is just a bug and it will be fixed I have over 100 songs and I’m not looking forward to putting them onto a new music app
738,Best Free Service available,5,10/31/2020 22:24,"You have to hear adds every once in a while but it’s free, you can search songs, albums, playlists, and artists. You can also create playlists, like songs, like albums, and more. This app is amazing."
739,Spammy,2,12/22/2020 0:54,Using the app too often hijacks you to their promoted content rather than serving the SoundCloud url you click. I uninstalled it several times and then reinstall it to get it to work without the hijack for some periods of times. I would keep it on my device if not for this. I use it because the mobile site is janky and doesn’t show all of the music in the playlists. So you’re forced to use this subpar app.
740,Bugs bugs bugs,1,12/14/2020 21:25,"I been paying for SoundCloud for about 2-3 months now and it’s was better when it was free 
Everysince I paid for the membership 
My SoundCloud app stops playing and close out by it self and when I’m home on WiFi and try to search new songs etc... it tells me “ ooops something went wrong “ 
My music don’t save to my playlist etc... 
can SoundCloud fix this problem or y’all need not to have premium if it had more issues then the free version"
741,YOU NEED TO GET THIS!,5,5/22/2020 15:16,"soundcloud amazes me. it is soooooo good!!! you can listen to all your favorite songs when your phone is turned off, but that’s not the end of it. You can listen to your favorite VERSIONS of songs too! Whether that’s slowed, reverb, “driving” etc. it’s all here! 10/10 recommend. This is a must-have."
742,I love SoundCloud! I just have a signing in problem.,4,10/1/2020 3:06,"Me and my boyfriend share an account and when I tried signing back into it, it kept saying that I needed to make sure I had an account or that I had all the information correct. He can sign in just fine, but it won’t let me sign in."
743,Hayden,5,3/21/2020 18:10,I love SoundCloud best app in my opinion to use to listen to music with you don’t want to pay for it but something I don’t like it won’t let me add more than 496 songs to my playlist and I don’t want to make multiple playlist I want just one playlist with lots of music can u plz fix that ?
744,Recent bug makes app unusable,3,4/19/2020 18:35,"This app has worked well for a long time but suddenly it keeps changing literally every song into Go only tracks which makes the app entirely unusable. I have to make a new account every time which is definitely a burden of course. Submitted a big report ticket but haven’t gotten any response yet. Wish me luck, guess I’ll look for another app while I wait."
745,Should be able to use on phone like you would on the computer,3,4/6/2020 19:13,Wish the app was more mobile friendly to where I could do the same on my phone as I would on a computer. I upload my content from my mobile phone I record using my phone but I basically waste my money subscribing because I don’t have a computer to use all that it has to offer
746,GO+ /:,4,3/28/2020 22:04,"i’ve been on soundcloud since like 2018(?) and for some reason it keeps going go+ for songs that aren’t go+ specifically on my phone, not on the website or on the beta app. i tried signing out and signing back in, re-installing it. this is the SECOND time it happened ): please fix it so i can listen to my music like normal again."
747,Incredible DJs and artists,5,12/12/2021 0:53,I’m glad SoundCloud fixed all of their royalty issues years ago & now that I’m back I found some old songs that got deleted and now I’m just building my collection so loving it. If you are a music lover this is the app for you!
748,Clearly there’s something wrong,2,9/2/2022 0:58,I do not know if it’s me but I had over a lot of things save on this playlist of SoundCloud on all my legs in the Music I love to listen to now suddenly I go back on the app and certainly I only have 17 likes I come back to all these songs for so long only for it to just be removed sometimes I said I have 17 like sometimes I says I have 15 etc. what is going on please fix this right away.
749,New UI and the issues it brings.,2,7/26/2022 8:51,"The UI isn’t that bad, I prefer the older look but whatever. No it’s the bugs, glitches and crashes whenever you leave the app and enter back in, you can’t choose a new song, you can’t exit and you can’t even search in the search bar.

Please for the love of god I’ve been using this app for a solid 3-4 years, do not make me use other similar apps."
750,If it ain’t broke don’t fix it,2,6/19/2022 5:28,"Maybe because I didn’t see a heads up, maybe I’m not a big fan of change, or maybe the loathing I have for this new layout (as of June 13, 2022) is warranted. The former lay out had the grace the not be stark black and white contrast eyesore currently making everything a brawl for attention. 4/10 for this supposed “upgrade”

Edit- now searching a track freezes the entire  page layout. Brilliant"
751,Needs song queue and other features!!,3,6/7/2022 15:58,While you’re able to add songs to a “queue” you’re completely unable to view the queue itself. And when you do add songs to a queue they play in most recent first which is annoying. Also the lack of proper shuffle and repeat features are insane. SoundCloud please fix this!!!
752,Liking songs,3,12/25/2021 15:01,SoundCloud please take away the limitations of liking alot of songs at the moment it literally makes no sense to put my account on timeout cause im “ liking too many songs” in a certain amount of time and on top of that yall telling ne my account will be banned cause if this action please change this policy we are not robots im just browsing and liking what i hear
753,People are sensitive,5,8/9/2021 3:43,The app is awesome and the people complaining about t comment section and how it says things about links and such and that is for 12+ you guys just want to find something to complain about get over it
754,My go to on new/unknown music and up and coming,5,7/13/2021 20:38,Id choose this iver every single music app out there. Doesnt have as much variety when it comes to features but i always find the best music because it allows all artists to flourish
755,I’ve been amazed at how people Are able to record my lyrics,5,12/19/2020 2:06,So I guess I have to say that I am amazed by this program because of it being able to record my lyrics I don’t have any programs like that available right now so this is cool
756,Worse than it’s absence,2,6/21/2021 13:28,The app does not provide any substantial value to an artist and listener. The interface is cluttered and cumbersome. Getting to a private track of mine take around 5 clicks. I should be able to access my own tracks quickly. It also is unable to handle secret links to playlists. It’s a huge pain to use and hasn’t receive any substantial improvement in all the years I’ve used it.
757,Great but needs a few fixes,4,3/2/2021 23:02,Whenever I try to add a song to a playlist with the term “Add to playlist” it instead creates a separate playlist which is annoying. Also needs to add a song rearrange feature to help rearrange your songs on a playlist or liked songs to play.
758,Great except for one MAJOR thing,3,12/9/2020 7:22,i love my playlists and the music choices available however the one huge thing that completely throws off my experience is not being able to repeat my playlists. this was an option before and it was a huge mistake to get rid of it please bring that option back
759,It’s good but way too many ads,3,11/23/2020 4:57,"I like using SoundCloud because it’s good to pick the songs I like and want to listen to then, but I also get ads almost every three or four songs. Most of the ads are double 30 second Non-skippable ads that are unavoidable unless you have premium. It’s good over all but the ads are becoming way too much."
760,Can y’all help me get my account back,3,10/7/2020 2:32,Hi I have a account on sound cloud and when I try to put my information in it won’t go through and I was wonder can y’all help me get it back because I don’t have the time to keep making new accounts I just keep loosing the music I listen to n that’s crazy so can you guys help me get my account back on sound cloud thank u
761,Like the App but where’s a CarPlay app?,2,9/28/2020 21:11,"I don’t have any issues with the app itself, the reason that I gave it 2 stars is because they still do not have support for a Apple CarPlay app, there are many other third party music applications that have their own app, I don't understand why with car play being for as long as it has we still do not have a dedicated app for it. I’ll gladly give 5 stars once a app for CarPlay comes out"
762,Playlists,3,6/11/2020 3:37,"Love the app use it 24/7 but have been thinking about switching platforms because you can only have 500 songs in a playlist which I think needs to be changed asap, right now I have found a work around by doing liked tracks but you can only like 50 songs a day, I really think they need to make the songs on playlists unlimited!"
763,WHAT IN THE WORLD,3,4/19/2020 2:08,"okay sooo.. i’ve had this app for a long time and it used to not give me any problems and i really lives it. but recently soundcloud logged me out of my account and wouldn’t let me back in. due to that, i lost so many amazing sounds. also many people are having problems with buying soundcloud go, i never did, but i prob wouldn’t recommend it. i’d get the app but be aware this may happen to you!!"
764,Please Update,2,3/12/2020 19:43,"I would’ve did 5 stars cause I love SoundCloud. But recently in the last 2 months I can only listen to 1 or 2 songs and then it just crashes! It freezes every like 30 seconds and it’s become close to impossible to even use the app without wanting to throw my phone at the wall. Can you please look into this and give me an update? When I notice it’s fixed, I will leave a 5 star review, until then it’s staying as it is"
765,Good but fix stuff that you say you fix plz,5,4/23/2022 21:12,Said they fixed downloaded tracks not being playable but it’s still broken. Kinda annoying when I’m paying for the app and it’s features are broken :/
766,Noti’s,4,8/30/2022 3:33,"Honestly, I don’t have a problem with the app. It works fine and always provides me the music that I want to listen to. I just find it odd how there isn’t an option to be notified when an artists releases something on their page. I just think it would be convenient."
767,Update,4,6/13/2022 14:11,"I’ve been using this app for 3 years, but something just got updated yesterday and now my account won’t load on the app or the website. It’s acting like an internet connection issue and not loading anything. Please check out this issue, i need SoundCloud!"
768,Apple Watch App Would be Amazing,5,8/10/2021 17:01,I like to put effort into my playlists and songs that I do come across and enjoy. It would be awesome to be able to like and add songs to playlists from a watch app for ease of use and consistency regardless of task at hand.
769,Need to improve search,2,11/14/2021 16:14,"In the search results, you can’t sort or filter results in the ways a user can sort and filter online. I’m looking for a way to sort with the latest tracks at the top, rather than just what’s most popular. This would be partially alleviated (but not totally fixed) if, in the search results screen, the app displayed how long ago each search result was posted."
770,Kicked me out of my account,2,9/19/2021 21:54,"it kicked me out of my account and i think it got deleted. it’s really great for music but it’s so annoying. now i can’t even sign back in or make a new account at all. i never commented or anything either so i don’t see why i would have been reported or something to get my account deleted. 

i tried to even get in my laptop and on other browsers, it just won’t work. ugh"
771,I highly recommend,5,4/23/2021 3:31,"I can’t even explain how good this app is, you could possibly upload your own songs and comment your opinion about those songs in the comments, which I find really cool. But you should"
772,SoundCloud,5,12/20/2020 20:43,"Wow! I really like this app! It’s a really good place to listen to music on. The music on this app helps me with all the school work and whenever I go on this app I feel relived. There are so many choices, so much music it’s unbelievable! Continue keeping up the great music!"
773,Glitch,3,1/22/2021 19:03,"I enjoy SoundCloud greatly, but since the last update, after a certain amount of time the app will suddenly stop playing and restart the app completely. It begins to get very frustrating because I have to keep unlocking my phone to fix it during workouts and such. Great app, just frustrated with this recent bug."
774,Best up today’s music,5,12/5/2020 17:32,Best listening app so far love the people who dedicated their time to making beats and music shout out to all my music lovers if y’all wanna be on the go y'all go to pay it’s pretty chill though relaxation at it’s finest when it comes to sound cloud
775,Ads and glitches,3,12/19/2020 8:41,Can I not get an ad after every song I play? And they all are 30 seasons and sometimes I cant skip them. It’s annoying that I always have to go out of the app because an ad plays after every song I click on. And the app is glitchy when I scroll through my likes tracks. It lags as well.
776,App is good but has been crashing recently,4,12/16/2020 19:29,"My songs consistently stop every couple minutes now. It only started this week, so it’ll hopefully be fixed soon. But it’s annoying. The app has been great otherwise for the past 3 years or so that I have used it"
777,Great but one issue,5,8/24/2020 17:16,"SoundCloud is one of the greatest things that humanity has created but there is one issue. I Changed my profile picture into a blood moon but when I go on my profile page, it is only the color red. I hope u can reach out to me a fix this issue. Thx"
778,Awesome crystal clear sound,5,1/10/2020 10:01,Thank you for a awesome experience using sound cloud I appreciate being able to listen to my shows at my leisure and the sound is like I am right there when it happened. Thank you for all you do to make it happen sound cloud.
779,Good but...,4,8/12/2020 21:24,"This is app is wonderful ! I use it all the time but theres just one problem..

When my connection is slow it acts up , Like i try to see whats the problem but then my volume goes up even though i didnt press the button.

Then my phone is all delayed and it glitches... FIX THAT so nobody has to go through that.. im on IOS"
780,It’s hard to say,4,5/22/2020 1:02,"To the point where you can find your favorite songs but you may not like the way they were made by others and you just want to hear the original,but it takes forever to look for the original or you can’t even find the original song."
781,IT’S ACTUALLY REALLY NICE,4,5/20/2020 15:42,"I downloaded SoundCloud about 1 or 2 weeks ago and I immediately liked it. My favorite thing about the app is I can play my music while off the app, and even when my phone is off. The one thing that I don’t like about it is all of the self-promoters on there. Like if you wanna get clout, you gotta earn it. But overall good app, I’ll give it a nice 4 stars."
782,"Great, but 1 issue!",4,4/3/2020 1:42,"Hello, this app is great. I get to listen to all my favorite songs, and all that, but there is one thing that always bothers me: one of the ads. It is about vaping of “DIP,” and when I have my device on high volume, the ad pops up, saying, “THIS IS A BONE SAW!!!” This really hurts my ears, as my device is always on the highest volume. Please remove this ad and “add” (😂😂) another one.

        Thank you."
783,Can’t use my playlist no more?,3,3/16/2020 18:41,Soundcloud is a very good app and I’ve been using it for a year now but for some reason I woke up today and tried to listen to my uzi playlist and all my songs required soundcloud go which was not needed before. I have been listening to these songs for months without a problem and have no idea why this is happening. Pls fix this.
784,Something’s wrong,4,2/20/2020 23:12,I was listening to music this morning and it was just fine. Then I came back a few hours later and every single one of my songs had “preview” on them I don’t know what’s wrong but I thought “ok maybe all I have to is update the app” and that didn’t work so I’m getting frustrated and I don’t know what to do
785,"Was great, but now u gotta pay",2,1/17/2020 14:57,"When SoundCloud first came around it was all free. I get it, now a days u want people to subscribe and pay. Give them ads, right? Soundcloud will give the people like me who have had them forever 2 30 deck d ads that u can’t skip. If you do not go with their SoundCloud go or plus whatever they call it, they will ruin your playlist with not one but two nice and long 30 second ads that i CAN NOT SKIP! What a good way to ruin your vibe"
786,Amazing,5,8/8/2022 5:00,"Definitely one of my favorites. SoundCloud is simple and has no problems when I use it. It’s easy to find a song, it’s easy to make a playlist, and it’s even better when there is no ads. Love it."
787,Good!,4,9/2/2022 11:23,"My only issue is that there is a limit on how many songs you can have in one playlist. I keep having to remove songs to add new ones. I think adding more space (like 1,000+ songs) would be awesome! Other than that, better than a lot of music apps!"
788,Wont stop advertising,3,8/28/2022 16:23,"ive been using soundcloud for quite some time now. Dont get me wrong, its an amazing app but now its constantly asking me to buy Soundcloud Go+. Whenever I look for a song that i can listen to without it, it constantly askes me to buy it. I really dont want to. If the developers could fix this, it would be greatly appreciated."
789,"Great app, however there are some bugs.",4,8/24/2022 2:19,"I love this app! I use it so much to listen to music when I feel the need to. However, I've had to keep reinstalling the app because it randomly pauses my music and sets it back 1 minute. Hopefully this is soon fixed, otherwise, this app is awesome!"
790,Good,4,6/13/2022 20:07,"The app is fully updated and there is nothing wrong with my internet because everything else that needs the internet is working perfectly. It’s a nice app but the days when this happens completely ruins it for me.

Edit: It was okay a couple hours later."
791,Decent but has issues,3,6/19/2022 22:49,I had quite a few issues trying to sign on after creating not one but 2 new accounts. It wouldn’t accept my credentials and would constantly redirect me to create account even though sign in had been selected. I’m still frustrated and not sure if I’ll keep it yet or go with a different app.
792,Fix app,4,4/11/2022 23:44,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for awhile, one time I got signed out randomly and I thought it was a bug but I was frustrated cause I made a lot of playlist, but then it just happened to me again today, but I tried to sign back in my iCloud but it just showed an error"
793,"Wow, just wow",3,6/13/2022 14:51,"So I’ve been using this app since I was 11 the app was fine until today’s update, and thanks to the new update, everything’s gone to crap! All my liked songs are gone and now I can’t search up music without seeing constant errors! Fix your app! Even before sure it’s had its bugs and glitches, but please, fix the app!"
794,Community love,5,4/8/2022 15:30,Thank you for sharing your experiences and music knowledge to us teaching us and motivitating us because as many of us we all just quit on it and just listening to motivators just like you it’s really appreciated thank you
795,Very nice app best app ever ever used for music,5,2/24/2022 0:35,Thanks for SoundCloud for being me so much love and happiness every day of me life. The music I find changed everything for me. And I feel true love now my wife is very delighted to hear songs that I’ve found over the years.
796,Best App Amazing Quality,5,2/19/2022 23:10,"The quality of this app is amazing! I used to pay for apple music but after i spent a lot of money i canceled the subscription and downloaded soundcloud, my friend asked me how i got my apple music quality so good and i told him i was using soundcloud"
797,SoundCloud goes hard,5,1/26/2022 6:48,I love SoundCloud there’s the most variety of music and underground artists. I love the personalized playlists based off what I actually like to listen to. It’s nothing but beautiful streaming! I choose SoundCloud over everything else.
798,Can’t click artist name,5,11/21/2021 18:18,"This just became an issue a few days ago . Seems when I try to click the artist who I am
Listening to , it doesn’t allow you to go to the page ? Maybe it’s a glitch with the new iOS 15.

-Dj ob1"
799,glitching,5,11/16/2021 1:43,I have been experiencing glitching. My phone freezes and then it exit out of the app and I have to reload the app and it keeps doing it on repeat over and over please fix!!! i’m an avid user and this app is one of my favorites! PLEASE FIX
800,Love it!,5,9/30/2020 22:11,Whatever algorithm SoundCloud uses is spot on. I’ve come across new artists I love and stay up to date on the artists I follow. There aren’t even that many ads that play for the free version. Between traveling and the pandemic I’ll even invest in the pay app.
801,Full of advertisements,1,10/21/2021 19:28,There is way too many advertisements. Its honestly frustrating having to listen to an advertisement after listening to two songs or even just opening the app having to listen to an advertisement immediately. Other apps would give one after 5 or more. Ive been using soundcloud for a long time and i enjoy the music others put on there but the amount of advertisements makes me miserable.
802,Needs update,2,5/2/2021 18:48,"I love this app to death it provides music you can’t find anywhere else, the only issue I have is that I have a paid membership and there is no queue for songs yet. If this was added to the app it would make it the best music platform out there, as well as fix the issue with the library and songs not being able to remove themself like they normally do."
803,Keeps crashing!,1,12/14/2020 4:47,"I’ve been a long time user of SoundCloud, however, as of late I’ve realized that I can have my playlist going for a few songs and then SoundCloud will stop playing the song all together and I won’t even have the option to play the song on my screen anymore. I don’t know what the cause of this is, but it’s honestly annoying and proving quite irritating as of late. SoundCloud needs to fix this issue immediately."
804,Pretty good.,4,12/13/2020 3:17,"Hello, I use sound cloud to upload tracks and things mainly.
I have one problem with it though. When ever I’m on mobile I always click on the upload track button but it always says verify your email in my email has already been verified..? Please help?"
805,Listening history,4,11/4/2020 4:07,I love the app like a lot but there are some things that you guys need to fix. I used to be able to listen to around 7-10 songs from your listening history. But now you can only listen to 2-5 songs and I don’t appreciate that.
806,Great App!,5,6/14/2020 17:13,"I find all the songs I look for for my playlists and sometimes find some other incredible versions whilst looking!  When I choose “high quality audio” for streaming etc. it really is great quality, without that “canned music” sound.  Thank you!"
807,Can we make it easier to make playlists?,3,7/28/2020 20:52,I love this app through and through but I contemplate moving back to Apple Music because they just make it so easy to make play lists. Can we come up with an easier way to make playlists instead of having to add each song individually. It is way to time consuming. That is my one and only complaint on this steaming app.
808,Please do it,5,2/26/2020 3:13,"I love SoundCloud but when I play my likes or playlists, when I’m done playing all the songs, it plays other random songs. I appreciate it if you replay the playlist after the playlist ends instead of playing random songs."
809,Needs an update!!,3,4/13/2020 23:11,I love SoundCloud but there’s way too many adds that pop up every time I go to change a song. Also a lot of glitches when I’m scrolling for a song and I’m forced to close the app and reopen it. You should also be able to edit your playlists without having to go on a computer to do so. There’s a lot of changes that needs to be made
810,Music good but...,2,3/31/2020 4:21,"The music functions are fine, but in my experience I’m getting a long (30 second) ad at the end of almost every song! Others i’ve talked to rarely get ads, yet i’ve deleted soundcloud multiple times because of how many long, unskippable ads i get after each song. Having some ads is fine, but one after every one or two songs which you can’t skip is incredibly annoying."
811,It’s okay! But there is a flaw.,4,7/7/2022 22:05,"I enjoy SoundCloud as it lets me post and listen to songs that aren’t on Apple Music!  It’s an amazing app but it keeps freezing, the song still plays and the track still moves yet I cant go back or do anything. Other than that it is alright for an app!"
812,😁,5,6/28/2022 1:34,"Hello, just want to let you guys know I really enjoy listening  on Sound Cloud to my favorite artists. You have some cool live collections for Martin Gore and Depeche Mode.  I also love the Cure, Morrissey, the Smiths, the Ramones and many others from my time. Thanks for making my days more enjoyable!"
813,"Well then, ‘something’ must’ve gave",5,6/13/2022 17:19,It’s working now but BOY does it act like there’s no data speed even though IK it’s fast enough to do every other thing my phone can do so don’t tell me your app is need of a weight watchers program like cmon guys 🤷‍♂️
814,10-May,4,6/19/2022 1:05,I think SoundCloud is a good music app and it works mostly anywhere! I just think theistic should play when the adds are playing. You should give adds that are useful to teenagers and adults. Has a lot of songs but not all of them and it’s good cause it plays smoothly.
815,SoundCloud is Fabulous !,5,3/11/2022 0:51,Love listening to all kinds of stuff on here and have to remember that I haven’t used it for awhile but I’m glad I came back to see things are still really great and I forgot to add stuff to my page for quite sometime…
816,SoundCloud is great,5,5/9/2021 23:34,"I think SoundCloud is great, but the ads bugs me but can’t complain because that’s how they make their money. Otherwise, the app is really good especially when you’re gaming! 10/10 I would totally recommend!😼😊"
817,Uploads not working,2,3/3/2022 15:37,Just bought a pro unlimited subscription yesterday  because it wasn't letting me upload anymore songs.... now it's just giving me an error and won't let me upload even though I have the pro unlimited version. When I try to Google it no one has the same issue and cannot get ahold of support to fix it. About to delete the app and be done with it .
818,Some recent problems,3,1/7/2022 21:02,"I’ve had the app for about 2 years now, and i really like it. however, recently i’ve been having this problem opening the app, were itll just close itself before actually loading. And, a couple days ago the app had deleted all of my liked songs, so now i don’t have any."
819,App review igggg,4,12/25/2021 1:55,"I love to use SoundCloud, butttt, the thing about it is I wish I could have access to more songs without going premium. Like for example: The song I want to listen to is only available with premium. I don’t want to pay every month, other then that the app is pretty good!😻🙏"
820,Good glitch,5,5/5/2021 23:22,SoundCloud has a glitch where after you play a song you will be able to listen to it without Wi-Fi with no Internet on repeat and that’s for every song without paying.
821,Great App For Just Vibing,5,4/16/2021 18:31,"Looking for good underrated music and talent? This the app to be at. Also a good place for upcoming talent who think they have a chance at the big shot. Last but not least, you can find that right artist, song, or opportunity for you on this app."
822,Don’t Miss Out,5,4/13/2021 23:49,"Many adjustments and upgrades have proven to itself, that SoundCloud ain’t going no where. Believe that! It will only grow to be better and better and the way I see it it’s Doper than ever don’t miss out. Tap in and see for yourself peace."
823,Connecting devices,5,7/13/2020 3:21,I love this so much app a lot but I was wondering if you guys could implement a thing where you can connect things through Bluetooth or like connect with devices like Alexa I would enjoy that a lot and I believe some others would enjoy that as well
824,Something is wrong with the update,2,3/15/2021 2:28,I’ve noticed for the past week or so the SpunCloud weekly playlists can’t refresh. The image changes but once I click it it’s the same songs as the previous playlist. I already deleted the app and reinstalled which changed the playlist to the the new one but the same thing occurs and I’m stuck on this one. Is this a bug?
825,Only issue,4,12/20/2020 7:02,I love soundcloud and it’s allowed me to find such great underrated songs and support small artists but I feel like the app has had laggy scrolling for a while now. The app itself doesn’t run smoothly for me and it makes it difficult to enjoy being on soundcloud.
826,Good but could be better,4,12/18/2020 13:45,"It always logs me out and doesn’t let me login it says asks me if I have a  account and I do have one it’s Blitzboy with 100+ followers 
It won’t let me back in and it happens every day over and over AGAIN.... P.S if u want to make more money lower the prices for go + so people will buy it"
827,Good stuff,4,11/23/2020 21:24,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for a long time. Maybe 10 years? I think there might be paid account now and weird restrictions and stuff. I’m not sure. I just keep logging in looking for royalty free copyright free music, and I use it. I give the artist credit and then email them a piece of the video."
828,Needs a lot of curation by the user,3,10/19/2020 13:21,"SoundCloud has provided me hours of listening pleasure, however there are a few crappy things.

First, if you let it play based on what you’ve hit “like” on, it eventually spirals into the land of “ugg no thanks!”.  You need to proactively like/skip stuff.

Second, there’s no CarPlay functionality.  So while I’d listen MORE, it’s just too tedious."
829,Get rid of the ads!!!!!,4,10/7/2020 4:12,Them ads annoying me everytime I picked a song a ad pops up and when I leave the app and come back to it and pick a different song a freaking ad pops up like please let me enjoy my music instead of listening to a freaking ad!! Please get rid of it!
830,"A really good app, but just one issue",4,8/16/2020 20:40,The app works pretty well and is one of my favorite music apps but the issue it has is the way the display the advertisement. The ad would play in video form and would cut out whenever I would try and view another app or something else on my phone. Can this be fixed???
831,Please fix this glitch,4,8/4/2020 7:05,"Dear SoundCloud team, I’ve been using SoundCloud for the better part of 2 years now and this glitch has just come to my attention.  The glitch makes it so you can’t unfollow anyone I’m not sure if it’s for everyone who uses the app or just me 10/10 app just please fix this it’s very irritating"
832,Troubleshooting,5,6/3/2020 8:16,The app is awesome but I’ve been running into a problem everyday. And as a subscriber I need this to be fixed immediately. Because I can’t listen to music when I want. Every time I try to open the app it loads forever and just closes by itself.
833,Ok,4,6/21/2020 22:59,Soundcloud is a great app and I would recommend it to a friend. But it always lags when I scroll down and no it’s because my internet or data. It always lags. I deleted it and got it back and it still lagged and it’s really annoying. I’m not sure if this happens to anyone else but it’s really really annoying. Please fix this.
834,I need some help please help me,5,5/18/2020 22:32,Ok so its great and all but today something came up i was organizing my songs but then i wanted to like a few other song but the i wouldn't let me like the songs for some reason no can someone please tell me what to do please I’m begging someone to please help
835,PLEASE GIVE US A ADD TO QUEUE,5,3/30/2020 20:29,I’ve been using soundcloud for the last 7 years please just give the people this. It’s so small and insignificant but it would make listening so much better if we didn’t have to wait to click a song to play next when we could just add it to queue
836,Need an Archive system,4,4/28/2020 10:29,"As a producer, its tough watching myself delete tracks because im constantly stuck between upgrading or waiting for the right time. For producers to have an archive system for tracks would make it easier for smaller artists and producers like me (because I have a lot of tracks). But overall, solid👌"
837,View cover art with click of a button,5,2/15/2020 21:19,I would like to view cover art as an option and think you for the new upload music option just what we need.
838,Not paying for music,3,2/2/2020 17:42,This is a good app but it came to the point where I can’t listen to the full songs anymore because of the fact that they want me to pay for go and it’s not worth it because I just want to listen to my favorite songs and I’m not paying for go and please soundcloud fix it I just want to listen to the real songs not 30 second previews
839,All I use,5,6/8/2022 4:09,"This new interface is so clean and slick! And smooth running too! SoundCloud has always been my favorite streaming service and with this new interface, I can see it only being smoother from here"
840,new update formatting is bad,2,6/9/2022 20:22,"the new update's design is comically bad.  Each song on stream is shown one at a time rather than multiple.  If I wanted bigger thumbnails I would have looked on the website.  I would suggest keeping it to multiple songs per screen rather than just one.  Soundcloud mentioned this version being ""cleaner"" looking.  I have a better adjectives ""devoid and lifeless""."
841,Best way to discover music you didn’t know about!,5,2/13/2022 16:11,"SoundCloud is in my opinion the best way to discover and share the music that you wouldn’t usually be able to experience and the best part is that it’s free, can’t beat that!"
842,Ads every other song,3,6/8/2022 2:46,"About to quit using this app. Every 2 or 3 songs it gives you an ad that are 30 seconds long. Sometimes it gives you 2 ads which together is ONE MINUTE OF ADS. I’m not spending almost $6 just to get rid of ads on an app where all the comments are filled with bots and slurs. Sorry, no thanks."
843,I love,5,6/18/2021 18:21,"so good, I listen to so much music, even the music that’s not released on other platforms - which is the benefit of this app. However, I do wish there was an add to queue playlist, which would be nice, but other than that, this app is amazing!"
844,Poor maintenance,1,8/17/2021 15:19,"Just came to leave a quick review, SoundCloud seems to have a terrible setup where if you select ‘forgot password’ on the app, it will present an error message and request you go to the web version to reset it. However, when you go to the webpage there simply isn’t even an option to log in with out it requesting ‘use through our app’ with no way to reset password 🙄 very irritating and much deserving of 1 star 👍"
845,can’t download my playlist,2,7/23/2021 16:13,i’ve had the same SoundCloud account since 2013 the app occasionally glitches which is super frustrating but I’ve always put it aside since all my music is on here. today i went to go download a playlist and I pay for SoundCloud go plus and have for the past years and for whatever reason it just won’t download this playlist
846,I want the free trial but I don’t have a credit card,4,8/19/2020 12:40,"So, the thing is that I need a credit card for a free trial, but it’s supposed to be free. I know it’s a marketing tactic to get people to forget to cancel the trial to charge their credit card, but you already have enough money, it’s not like you’re broke. I just don’t like that some companies do this."
847,Fantastic way to find songs,5,7/19/2020 8:52,"If you looking something new to jam to, this app definitely is the way to do that. Took awhile but I have a playlist of songs that sound much better than a lot of these hits on radios, but that’s my opinion. Download it and prove me wrong ;)"
848,Amazing for chill sounds and some relaxing music,5,7/17/2020 19:56,The thing that annoys me the most is when your at the end at your playlist and it Just plays a different songs- Also Random ads I understand it’s free and all I just hate ads- ANYwAys overall it’s amazing! Recommend
849,Honesti’s SoundCloud Review,5,4/8/2020 21:41,SoundCloud is a good app it has all the music but there’s one problem some music is just a preview so you can listen to the whole song in less somebody else recorded the song and posted it on there page but other than that SoundCloud is a really good app.
850,This app could be so much better,3,6/10/2020 16:48,"This app is fine but has been stagnant for years now. Yes it works but artists have no ability to access half of their features through this app. Even things as basic as messaging! Not to mention the ads that now flood this app. I understand needing to make money, but when you play an add every 2 songs, it ruins the experience"
851,Difficult to cancel,1,5/5/2020 18:54,"You can not cancel from in the app, when trying to open the web browser version of SoundCloud it takes you to the app. I had to go to “help” on their site and look up how to cancel. Once I was in the right place it has been horribly formatted for mobile devices and was extremely difficult just to click on what I need to. It’s obvious they made it as hard as possible to cancel for this cheap bs they get one star. Good streaming horrible service"
852,Greedy,1,1/19/2020 16:14,"I have been using SoundCloud for a year and it has been awesome, there have been times where I wanted to add a song to my playlist but it was for SoundCloud plus members. So I just said okay and moved on. However, this morning, I go onto SoundCloud and they have made almost every song a SoundCloud plus song. So 3/4ths of my playlist I can no longer listen to now because they got greedy and wanted people to pay 13 dollars a month. Don’t buy unless you plan on paying for premium."
853,Great but why?,4,1/4/2020 2:01,Love the app works great with all my devices and has great quality. But why is it that some songs aren’t available anymore by major artists that were available maybe a week before? These are also artists in my same country. If this could be fixed the app would be amazing!
854,Wonderful meditation,5,6/19/2022 14:31,"Maybe I could record some music and upload it too. Music that I compose, myself. I love the “Unstoppable” and also “deeper and deeper”, both by Dr. Naram and a musician whose name Escapes me at the moment, because I am just now starting my day. He should be more famous, whoever he is!"
855,Wiped Liked Songs Resolved,4,9/2/2022 8:31,"Awhile ago, the recent update randomly wiped all my liked songs, 

This however has been fixed, though no prior warning to users of this possibility happening has left a sour taste in my mouth, however I am happy the issue was resolved."
856,Here again..,4,8/28/2022 2:42,"I really don’t like making reviews that isn’t about any ups but… I keep typing in my (Non GO+) song in the search bar, than when I press the song it brings me to GO+ another glitch that needs to be fixed like the app randomly freezing."
857,SoundCloud,5,4/26/2022 19:10,"Most of the songs are free, most recent songs on your history list will download if you don’t have service you can still play those few songs."
858,new update is crashing constantly,3,5/24/2022 0:16,"i love soundcloud with all my heart but for gods sake i just had it crash 3 times playing the same song. please fix this asap, i still believe in y’all but the app is almost unusable due to the constant crashing. i have pro unlimited with all my songs downloaded so this is kind of a pain. 
PLS FIX"
859,The best app ever,5,3/14/2022 5:07,The best app ever 📲tap in wit SoundCloud/Musi you should try Musi to it’s just as good as SoundCloud but less adds and u can watch the video it has all original songs and it’s also 10 stars 🌟 thank you 🙏🏽 download both of them Don’t forget “Musi”
860,My favorite music app,5,10/27/2021 15:32,It's an amazing app that lets you listen to music even if your phone is off which is always handy and useful to me in times as I play video games or doing some sort of work. Very nice. I suggest it to everyone!
861,More sounds 😩,4,11/13/2021 15:16,I have been using soundcould for the past 2 years but some of the songs. I listen to don’t pop up and some times There are just remix’s and. Different things. I don’t want to hear which doesn’t satisfy me. So could you at least put more sounds
862,SoundCloud,5,7/4/2021 1:29,"Amazing , sound quality is great , you could listen to different up coming artist and even make you an account to start as an upcoming artist and do lots of things and create a platform and do lots of things so it’s great 😍"
863,My 2 cents,1,9/8/2021 15:27,"So sum this up, this is my favorite music app ,but as of more recently it’s progressively starting to disappoint me. I felt like this app is forcing to buy premium or SoundCloud go to listen to music that isn’t even premium by SoundCloud. I can’t even search a song without it showing me all the plans...what’s going on SoundCloud? This wasn’t a problem before, and now I can’t seem to find new music or enjoy anything without the app shoving a plan in my face."
864,Great App,5,6/11/2021 11:31,"I found this app on google when I was looking up who made the music for the FNF NEO mod. Then I entered the website for SoundCloud. I had liked the concept so I decided to download it for myself. So far I am really enjoying this app. Anybody looking for a good music app, download this app."
865,Fix SoundCloud weekly!,3,5/6/2021 1:29,I’m tired of the same songs I already have saved come up on my weekly playlist. I go there to search for songs I’ve never heard and it’s the same thing almost every time. Fix it please!! Also it would be nice if scrolling through music wasn’t so glitchy all the time.
866,Can’t Like/Unlike Anything Within the App,2,4/16/2021 23:08,"I’m not sure if it’s because I’m using the free version or if it’s a bug, but I can’t add anymore music to my liked list or even remove anything from the list. Please fix this. There are many songs on there that I can’t listen to because certain accounts shut down and I can’t remove anything of the songs that are unavailable."
867,Sound cloud rate,5,1/20/2021 8:29,I love this app to hear music have been using it for years and then you could swipe off the app and still listen to the music and it also has a bunch of good unreleased music from rappers and it’s just the best💯
868,So,4,4/3/2021 6:07,"I really like this app, it has many songs, unlimited skips and in all is just amazing. I do have a request for a sleep timer though! It would be fun and would be nice to listen and fall asleep to my favorite music without worrying that it won’t turn off. But this really is an amazing app."
869,Sound cloud is great,5,1/14/2021 14:25,"I have this app on every device and it’s great because it’s the only app that allows you to listen to music while on other apps, and I highly recommend this app for anyone who likes music"
870,Bug report,5,9/13/2020 17:23,Sometimes when I look up profiles I’m following it says I’m not following them even tho it says I am in my following and sometimes it will even actually unfollow them please fix your app
871,Use to be great,2,11/11/2020 22:19,"Use to use this when it was free and ad free. Had a lot of music removed my my list. My review from years ago removed as well. This has great music but to put it at 13 a month? Cmon now not even apple is 13. Minute long commercials are a joke. Imagine working out and a Mc Donald's ad come on ""you want a Big Mac"". Now if that doesn't kill your workout I don't know what will. Horrible how they did this app."
872,I love SoundCloud,5,5/22/2020 12:26,I make a lot of playlists on here as a hobby. SoundCloud is amazing and has a lot of music that couldn’t be found anywhere else and you get to hear new stuff from local to foreign djs all over the world it really brings people together I wish soundlcloud made a comeback
873,Yes,4,8/15/2020 10:53,"App is ok, soundcloud is great. Although I found one problem , you can’t see track’s description/details in app also you can’t go to desktop version from any browser on iPhone, that is terrible! Some musicians or up-loaders write significant information there like tracklists, etc. Please, fix it, this bug is limits really badly."
874,The new update,3,7/25/2020 19:25,"I usually like SoundCloud it has all my songs, I can find songs easily but with this new update almost all of my songs are know premium, and understand SoundCloud has to make but I believe that the songs that you already have on  your playlists should be free   Because I picked those songs before they were premium."
875,This app is good but there is a small problem.,4,7/16/2020 18:22,"I’ve been using this app for a few years now and recently when I’ve tried to play a song the whole app would crash, I would tap the song I want, it would play for a second, and then it would crash. Please fix this. Thanks."
876,Fix the likes & follows,2,6/25/2020 2:50,"As it stands now, the app is broken. Neither likes nor follows work rendering me unable to actually add any artists or playlists i’d like to listen to. I recently started trying to add my long list of artists and this is simply impossible. 

In regards to ads, they're annoying but understandable given the free use of their services. As for Go+, it seems a bit excessive. 

One more thing I’d like is for the search function to be more robust."
877,It’s an amazing app,5,3/7/2020 21:07,This is a amazing app I can be anywhere and this got me it doesn’t delete my songs from my playlist it plays the right song and doesn’t change it and the best part is that it’s free like. Omg like amazing get SoundCloud today you won’t regret it thank you
878,Super glitchy,2,4/8/2020 4:05,"Just a couple of months ago it was working completely fine, i used it all the time to listen to my music. and all of the sudden it glitches out after every song? or i’ll try to scroll and my screen will freeze up and then the app will shut off. i’ve only kept it to see if it will start working again, but so far it’s only been getting worse, i might delete it 😕."
879,"Upset, very",4,3/8/2020 17:08,overall i do love this app but i hate hate that there’s no option to queue a song on mobile devices. when you’re hanging out with people and they all want a song it becomes very hard to remember all the songs. Thus causing us to move onto another app. I’d love for a queue feature in the future.
880,Awesome ‼️,5,2/9/2020 16:16,It’s a rlly rlly rlly good app!!I can find all my songs I want and listen to all of them at the highest quality possible :)).It has its monthly bugs and stuff but they always end up getting fixed and even if you don’t have SoundCloud +.It doesn’t bombard you with ads like Spotify.I love it ‼️❤️
881,It’s ok...,1,2/18/2020 2:33,"The app is ok.. but I wanted to hear music offline... I have to pay for that.. no thank you. It’s a good app because I can hear my music.. but I wanted to hear my music offline.. sorry. Also... when I’m playing the songs, it kind of advances one second into the song and it doesn’t sound right... and the songs don’t sound like when i hear them on YouTube...like it’s missing something... anyways, it’s an ok app but not as good as I thought it was going to be..."
882,SoundCloud is great for all,5,2/10/2022 14:18,There been music I have missed since I graduation high school back in June 2012 that I don’t see on on other streaming service but I could always count on SoundCloud for the music like to hear sometimes.
883,Good but can be very meh,4,9/5/2022 20:44,"It is a great app although there are some things that I would change. For example, I would add the feature to add your own pictures for the thumbnail for playlists. I can’t really think of anything else but otherwise Soundcloud is a great app!"
884,My view of SoundCloud,5,11/13/2021 5:32,SoundCloud is one of my favorite apps helps for listening and producing music if you’d like and there is all kinds of cool music than you can also listen to offline . I recommend people get this amazing app
885,Good app,5,10/24/2021 20:20,It’s a great app in my opinion because one you listen to the whole song online you can always listen to it offline and there’s great edit sounds and versions of most of the songs.
886,Zoei,5,8/12/2021 5:41,Good for picking and choosing what you wanna play. You can just heart the songs you like and shuffle through them. It’s nice when you haven’t heard a song you like in a while and it just plays randomly in your shuffle.
887,Adds,4,1/21/2021 19:21,"I love this app but the only problem I have with this app is the adds.I think I can speak for everyone when I say every other song there is like two adds,It’s actually a little crazy how much adds there are but other than that great app."
888,Too many bugs,3,6/15/2021 15:02,"The original stuff on here is good and everything, but I have no words for the formatting. Last time going on the app was to look at something that had just dropped, but upon playing it a new song played every time it was started over. Never got to hear that song"
889,Amazing,5,3/14/2020 21:21,i luv soundcloud when you don’t have wifi you can still listen to like 1-2 songs from a playlist yes it’s only 1-2 but at least you can listen to food music or if you just have a song on you can still listen to it
890,Ever Increasing Adds,1,10/26/2020 23:56,"Have used for roughly 5 years now, over time the amount of pop ups adds and interruptions unless you pay for their premium has steadily increased and using the service has been an experience of mounting annoyance rather than pleasant enjoyment. I hope to find another way to compile and enjoy the music I like and upon finding it I will be dropping SoundCloud without a second thought, and glad to put the aggravation behind me."
891,Download error,4,9/25/2020 23:34,"I currently have the like 5 dollar plan for soundcloud and whenever I like(favorite) a couple songs, one will not work and when I try to delete it from my liked songs it automatically downloads right back.. any tips?"
892,Just Why,1,8/4/2020 19:35,I loved listening to music on this all the time but now almost every song on my playlist requires Go+ so now it’s basically useless I don’t understand why almost every song requires songs or any song requires it in general most people can’t pay for stuff like this bc most of us r mainly teens who r unemployed and can’t get a job at the moment i give this app a 1 star just because of this but everything else is good but the Go+ has been taken way to far
893,Some features from PC are not on app and being kicked from app,3,8/4/2020 16:31,Things like changing playlist photos are not available on the app. It would be really cool to be able to change all of that whilst using my phone. I also am kicked from the app constantly. I am a Soundcloud Go user and it is way too expensive for what I get from the app. Please change this.
894,It was good,2,6/18/2020 19:48,"I’ve used SoundCloud for over 2 years now. It was amazing, unlimited skips, no unwanted songs added to your playlist, hardly any songs were premium. I wrote this review because all that’s changed now. I go to listen to my everyday playlist only to find out “you’ve reached your monthly listening limit”. Excuse me?! The whole reason I switched to soundcloud was because I’m a broke b and soundcloud was good for that."
895,There’s a lot of problems,1,6/14/2020 2:40,There’s tons of glitches in this app I’ve tried removing songs but still keep taking over a whole playlist half of the time I play any songs on here. I’ll just get dead silence while still playing a whole song even the ads are causing a problem i got 3 ads in a row and I barely play half a song I’ve tried resetting my phone and even getting a new phone but this  app is carrying glitches
896,Great but one Thing needs To Get FIXED,4,4/9/2020 8:37,"It’s all fantastic, the music the genres and all but for some reason, the app does this thing where all the music you can listen to for free then goes into SoundCloud Go and it’s really irritating. Albums and songs that are free then have to be paid for to listen. That needs to be fixed."
897,THE NEW APP IS TERRIBLE,1,2/22/2020 5:40,"I liked the old soundcloud but i always thought it needed improvement. The new soundcloud is ten times worse! You can barely see or navigate and you cant make playlists or easily access and edit them! The lack of functionality is annoying and so many crucial features are taken away. Im patiently waiting for a better update.

Edit: STILL WAITING FOR A REAL USER INTERFACE UPDATE. The zoomed in album cover scroll effect needs to go. A light and dark mode is needed. “Up next” on mobile etc.."
898,I BELIEVE IN YALL NEEDS IMPROVEMENT DO BETTER,1,2/16/2020 16:14,"Aren’t you all like 20 year olds with an associates or something like you are all smart enough to fix bugs on this app you literally just have to ask a regular civilian to use the app for a week and you will find 10-30 problems with the app.

Like cmon make the app as least heavy on the processor of the phone 

 can't  rename playlists on the app there are so many features like shuffle play after you pick a song or removing specific song from your history"
899,SoundCloud is where it’s at💯💯💯,5,7/25/2022 16:23,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for many years as an artist myself, but most of the time I use it to bump all the new new tracks ya know!

Anyway this app is always consistent, and easy to use; Everyone stay Fabulous/Blessed!!"
900,Lop issues,4,6/28/2022 3:49,"Well, I have been using this app for a year now and it is good. After an update, I can’t loop my playlist or the sounds I have liked. I have no issues with Pete praying but I want my songs to be looped over and over again. I think this app would be very good if it has loop."
901,Playlists,5,6/10/2022 18:06,Please make it so we can search up songs in a specific playlist I have too many that have over 300 songs each and finding that one song is s a b****
902,Love the app but I wish playlist customization was better,4,6/13/2022 10:45,"i love the app but I WISH it had a little better playlist customization, like, being able to choose a pfp for the playlist and changing being able to rename playlist"
903,Has some of the best songs that aren’t found anywhere else.,5,3/24/2022 4:10,"SoundCloud is the best music app when it comes to finding hidden gems, I mean, it’s indisputable. And the recent UI changes just make it 10x more enjoyable to use."
904,Rating,4,5/8/2022 0:53,The only reason I would not rate this app a 5 is because there is no shuffle which means that it plays the song in a certain order it would definitely be a 5 if there was a shuffle option
905,Good app,4,4/14/2022 2:28,"Good app but I had to rate it four stars. It’s not because of the music quality or anything, just that I was targeted. Some account called Winstina or something had a link to her “website” and I clicked on it. It led to a website with many images of nude women. I was eleven.

Please update your security, SoundCloud devs.

Bye."
906,Excellent,5,2/17/2022 20:53,Can y’all add a queue on mobile that will allow multiple songs to play when I press next up. The desktop version does this but mobile apparently doesn’t
907,Good music app compared to others,5,8/11/2021 5:21,You get to chose what song you want to listen to or shuffle a playlist. You can also skip ads if you turn off WiFi and service (I’m on iPhone)
908,SoundCloud,5,10/23/2020 0:22,This is definitely a five out of five because they have the best songs and slowed and reverb. But can you guys cut down on the adds plz because when my favorite song comes on there is always an add. I love it tho so much 😌💅🏽✨
909,Horrible,1,8/10/2021 19:13,"If i could give -5 stars i would, and that would still be generous. This app has so many bugs and problems that are never fixed, but everytime theres an update they somehow make it even worse. They should real be paying me to use it with all the stress it causes. Only reason i use it is because of certain music by artists that I can't find anywhere else. Don't ever download this if you don't want raised blood pressure"
910,More options,4,6/28/2021 0:25,As a professional artist I suggest you should be able to post a mini clip of your song (while playing the song) n be able to post it also have a better visual of who’s listening to your music like deep scan
911,Ads trigger even when skipping songs,1,6/24/2021 23:13,"If you’re not a premium member, you have to listen to ads after a few songs. This itself is fine.

However. The app has no one of sensing if you’re just trying to quickly find a good sounding song. If you keep skipping songs and you only listened to 5’ish seconds of each. It still triggers ads. 

This punishes the user as they are either forced to listen to songs they don’t like to reduce ads per hour, or listen to obscene amounts of ads per hour via skipping.

This inconvenience was enough for me to uninstall the app. I would have considered subscribing to a subscription. But I can’t even properly explore music without being maliciously barraged with ads. I’m good. Don’t use this service."
912,User-antagonistic,2,6/18/2021 19:25,"This app constantly does things I never asked it to do and can’t turn off - it autoplays regardless of my settings, it incessantly pops up demands for me to “like” tracks as if I don’t already know what that means, etc. - the only reason I use it is because playing in the browser is even worse. But man, this app truly puts business needs ahead of user needs every time."
913,Love SoundCloud but make some updates!,4,3/19/2021 23:58,Please separate playlists and albums into different category’s! It’s hard for me to quickly access my playlists without having scroll through all the random albums I’ve liked.. Otherwise I love it :)
914,Recommendation,4,12/10/2020 5:12,The app is great by all means 💯 I do think it needs to have a option to pay for all the ads to be gone forever like a one time fee .. and I think it should add a next up option for all your music not just two songs after
915,terrible music quality,3,12/5/2020 1:38,"compared to other streaming services and apps this is by far the worst, the only good thing about soundcloud is it’s community and artists surrounding it. If they didn’t have that then they would be complete doo doo, the quality of the sound is not good and it even doesn’t compare to others."
916,Terrible,1,10/25/2020 1:31,"It’s super glitchy, it repeatedly crashes, glitches, and doesn’t even open when I open the app, plus I’m basically being harassed by ads, never have I once called in my life and honestly I never will, I keep on having to close this app and open it again to not get another ad, I hate this app with a passion, hopefully something better becomes popular so that I can download it and listen to music without any glitches."
917,Keeps Pausing Randomly,5,9/1/2020 17:42,I don't know why but it's been pausing randomly whenever I'm on other apps and it's so annoying!! I have done everything in my power to not let it keep pausing but nothing’s worked.. if this is a glitch or a bug please fix it.
918,Skipping songs,3,9/15/2020 1:45,Love the app but it skips one-three songs on playlists and such and ifs annoying as hell to work with. At this point i just stopped using all together. Its hard enjoying using this so much yet you can’t even listen to what you want to casually without having to handle the app in order to use it as intended
919,Glitchy with Obnoxious advertisements,1,9/10/2020 18:06,"Why do I have to get an ad after the app was unresponsive? Why are these video ads that won’t play if my phone is locked? Such a rude free version..... please integrate banner advertisements that don’t interrupt the music. Current advertisements are just infuriating and prevents me from listening to new artists because I will just play a single mix and never learn the artists names, just to avoid being tortured w subway and insurance ads."
920,Soundcloud,4,6/2/2020 14:16,"Soundcloud is a great music app. However every now and then all my songs become to the paid version of soundcloud, they become no longer free to listen and then i have to purchase the other version for the songs to be listens too. I hope that they fix this soon."
921,Works Great,5,2/18/2020 18:11,This is an easy straight forward app. It allows you to listen to music without your screen being on and has never locked up or been hard to use. I recommend that everyone give it a try.
922,SoundCloud is my life now 😂,5,1/16/2020 22:36,"I signed up when I found out I can create a library for my Roland505 and i have had my head in the clouds ever since!! I picked up a nice pair of headphones and a new phone now I’m wired in. No turning back now and I highly recommend for any music lover, try it on for free lol!!"
923,I love it but...,4,1/3/2020 21:21,"I live SoundCloud. It’s has all of my favorite songs and most of them are free, but sometimes I look up a popular song and it’s premium. That makes me upset and makes me have to find a remix or a cover that i don’t want and have to listen to. But that’s kind of a personal problem. Other than that I love it!"
924,Customer Service Masterclass,5,8/16/2022 19:26,"I had just complained about a bug effecting the shuffle and search features. SoundCloud immediately fixed the bug and responded. Perfect customer service, how it should be. Well done SoundCloud!"
925,10/10.,5,3/16/2022 2:19,"I’ve been using soundcloud since 2017, and it’s been a great experience! Never had flaws, and it’s nice seeing them pay artists correctly. I recommend getting into it if you haven’t! ^^"
926,Update is fine,4,6/12/2022 0:30,"The update is fine, I don’t really use SoundCloud that often. But how can I turn on black mode through SoundCloud without having to turn it on from my iPhone settings? The update seemed to have gotten rid of the feature"
927,They’ve ruined the app with monetization,1,5/22/2022 20:04,"I’ve used the app on and off over the last 4 years and it’s nothing compared to what it used to be. Nowadays after 2 songs they try and give you a ad, for me I can’t get past 3 songs without a ad playing. I think I can speak for everyone, no one likes ads. Because of this I literally go out of my way to not use sound cloud, this is the definition of a fall from grace."
928,"The One, The Only, SoundCloud",5,2/9/2022 10:14,"Long time member of the SoundCloud arena and highly recommend their services due to the fact that SoundCloud has become a facet of online music distribution and copyright adherence. From bloggers, to singers, producers, to music buffs, SoundCloud is the place to listen!"
929,Has songs that others don’t!,5,12/15/2020 2:34,I’ve been looking for the Post Malone Ft Eminem song everywhere and couldn’t find it. Finally downloaded SoundCloud and found it right away! So I canceled my Apple Music and signed up for SoundCloud!
930,About settings,4,12/13/2021 7:36,"I love SoundCloud but I think it should have a whole category for Siri on IPhones. It would be a lot easier to play music like playlists and it will be similar to Apple Music. I’m not saying do it, I’m just suggesting. Thank you for reading enjoy your morning/day/evening/midday-night-midnight!😁"
931,Great service but one flaw,4,12/12/2021 2:39,"I find all the songs I look for majority of the time, but how come we cant loop a playlist? You can loop a single song but can’t make it to were at the end of the playlist it just restarts? It’s 2021 about to be 2022 how is this not a feature"
932,love the app but,4,2/23/2021 15:35,"I love the app but I don’t know if i’m the only one whose, “the upload and soundcloud weekly,” is not updating like I’ve had the same songs for both the past few weeks so I can’t find new songs that are like the songs I listen to, please fix this."
933,"Great app but,",5,9/8/2020 0:05,"I like this app a lot, but the problem is it keeps crashing every time I listen to a song for like 5 seconds. It’s very annoying and i hope you can do something about this. Thanks!"
934,There’s a problem,1,11/1/2020 18:08,"I used to have this app but deleted because my phone storage then I wanted to download it again because iTunes cost money but when I tried it sign up and press done the button doesn’t work. Signing back up doesn’t work either. Like I try to press the done button it just doesn’t work. So if the creators end up seeing this please try to fix this, thanks.

(P.S, I rated it 1 star because I can’t even use it)"
935,Only down is the ads but I have Apple Music and use this more,4,10/25/2020 16:35,Sound cloud has all the songs and remixes and slowed versions when other platforms don’t have them its really good the ads get annoying but other than that it’s a great app for music
936,Review,5,4/16/2020 19:58,SoundCloud is a great app in my opinion and I can look up specific songs and they will show up without me having to worrying that I won’t be able to hear that one song until like 20 minutes later.
937,One problem,4,6/9/2020 22:04,"Great app! Just one problem, when I try to switch through a song sometimes it goes to the last song, which mad it hard to make a video on my channel, it’s small but it’s still a bug, if you can fix this then it would be five stars."
938,Please fix the playlist,3,3/21/2020 1:09,I can’t even delete music off of my playlist without the app glitching and deleting the wrong song. I love this app and I’ve had it for years but this has to come to an end sometime soon. I see reviews going years back stating the same exact thing I said above. Why hasn’t it been fixed after all these years ?
939,Great app but crashes a lot,2,4/2/2020 21:52,I would give it 5 stars because it honestly the best app to stream music. Maybe 4.7 because there is no play next or queue feature but definitely a 2 because we are paying 6 to 14 bucks for an overload of slow load times and crashes. SoundCloud needs to seriously step up their game because I am done with paying them money and them not fixing what they should.
940,great app but ..,2,2/2/2020 18:32,"this is my fav music app when i dont have wifi, everything was great until all my music started going go+. i think its stupid that you have ur FULL songs on there without go+ n then everything starts turning into 30 sec previews,that is stupid n utterly crazy, if u wanted it on go+ it should have been released as go+ in the first place, im not gonna pay nothing bc all u guys want is money, this is unnecessary. im getting a new music app."
941,Its a great app but some problems.,5,1/24/2020 21:55,"Sound cloud I would say is a good app. But there is some problems, I don’t like that there is previews and I wish they had the full version of the song. Reason 2, I wish that there was no go+ thanks for this app and have a great day. 🙂"
942,A way around the system the cheapskate way,5,1/22/2020 20:39,"every time an ad pops up I quickly close the app, rinse and repeat so I never have to listen to ads. At best I only have to listen to 3 secs our of the min & half of ads (SoundCloud upgraded from 1 / 15 sec ad — 3 / 30 sec ads like tf)"
943,:),5,8/25/2022 14:51,This is an amazing app to use when your stressed or just wanna listen to some music it helps me a lot I love this app it has many songs and albums and everything 100% would recommend
944,Not able to remove songs from playlist -plz fix,1,9/2/2022 10:40,"Not able to remove songs from playlist -plz fix 
There is a glitch where you cannot remove songs from playlist when you download the latest version of this app please fix this is very annoying I would like to edit my playlist and remove songs as needed its function is no longer available why?"
945,SoundCloud j-steady,5,7/5/2022 19:07,I have been using SoundCloud since the prime days in 2016 it has done nothing but show me the amazing artist that this app has to offer but also the diversity is truly amazing. As an artist or listener you will always get the best experience
946,Sound cloud is crashing,5,6/25/2022 2:05,Hi I been using sound cloud for a year and it’s really good but ever since the new look update sound cloud has been crashing for no reason I hope you can fix this
947,Recommend,5,4/16/2022 15:17,"This app is amazing you can create playlist listen to your favorite songs,even when you have other apps open. Quality is very good also"
948,I love it,5,3/27/2022 2:19,It’s great it has everything you need you can have song on repeat find any song you want and even make stations that are similar to the particular song
949,Ja’Kaylen James’ Review,5,4/29/2021 2:07,"In my opinion, this is an app I would highly recommend. There’s over a variety of songs to choose from. You can select different songs and customize your account to your preference."
950,Bruh,1,9/10/2021 0:23,I just got the app and I made an account but it would let me edit my profile so I thought ok maybe I just need to sign out and get back in but when I tried to sign in it wouldn’t let me get back in so I tried making a new account and they said that they think I was a robot account when I clearly wasn’t so I tried getting back to my original account but it kept saying my password was wrong when it clearly wasn’t.
951,Terrible,2,7/15/2021 23:31,"It’s terrible you have to pay 12$ a month to get 75% of songs it’s terrible I wish that it was just all free it wasn’t worth it, just get Apple Music for 4 dollars or 8 dollars. You also have followers and you can’t approve them random people just start “following” you. Also you can’t make playlists and it’s impossible to find any clean songs."
952,"Great app, can’t always find everything I need though",5,11/19/2020 23:05,"Like the title says, I can’t always find everything I need but I hardly attribute that to the app itself, which has always been great in my experience."
953,It crashes sometimes,4,12/15/2020 4:56,"SoundCloud is a very good app! I use it when I’m in school or going to sleep but...I do so happen to realize that it dose crash time to time. For me it crashes maybe a hour or 4 hours in. But other that that it’s a very good app. 

(Pls try to fix the crashing)"
954,rating,4,12/14/2020 1:23,"Honestly it’s really good. I use it for music when i’m on the road or doing stuff. But the ads about Nic A Teen and vapes, are really annoying. I don’t vape and it’s really pointless for me and maybe for others. Take them down and post them somewhere else or something."
955,It’s very unique and real sexy,5,9/4/2020 20:13,I have Apple Music and it’s cool and all to download but SoundCloud has masterpiece music pieces were oldies and new era come alive like a personal DJ they get redone in such a beautiful way it’s almost mesmerizing... I recommend it get it no matter what other music streaming companies you may have.
956,bug,4,11/19/2020 19:54,It doesn’t let me tap on more listening history and it’s been like this for a while now i wonder if you guys can fix it because i can’t ever access my listening history it lets me tap on it it just does not do anything
957,"Great app, just a suggestion",5,7/7/2020 12:29,i love soundcloud! i just wish that for the playlist covers it would stay the same as i  would put it. I like to theme match everything and it’s just frustrating when it won’t stay the same.
958,Found a glitch that is app breaking,4,8/5/2020 21:42,"While I was listing to music on here I went to heart a track that I accidentally unhearted it uhearted itself again! I trued everything to like it again even deleting and reinstalling the app and the glitch still happened, Even on songs that haven’t been liked!"
959,"Its great, but please remove the “this is a bone drill” ads.",4,7/9/2020 14:53,"Imagine this, your listening to your favorite song and after that song you feel good then you hear it, “this is a bone drill *SCREEEEEEEEEEE*” it shatters your eardrums and makes you angry. The other ones are fine like the old spice ad, its a song so its pleasant to listen too. So thats my issue with it."
960,"Great, but",4,4/2/2020 7:16,"This is my go to for music and podcasts. However, when I scroll a little bit down, it starts to lag and glitch, and when I try to go back to the home section, it lags even more when I scroll. I would give it five stars if the “bug” is actually fixed."
961,Every song is going into their subscription,1,3/19/2020 17:40,I’ve been listening to SoundCloud for years and I never worried about their subscription packages because idrc. But to my surprise for this past week a lot of songs that were free to listen to have been made a go+ exclusive. This to me is scummy as I’ve listened to some of these songs for years with no problem and now I have to pay for it. I understand SoundCloud hq needs money but this isn’t how you go about it.
962,Great App! But one problem,5,2/24/2020 4:19,"I love using SoundCloud, I use it literally everyday! But I’m getting a little frustrated that all the songs I listen to are turning GO+, and then to play it I have to pay and before, they weren’t GO+. So I just want to ask why this is happening?"
963,trying to trick you,4,2/28/2020 15:27,"soundcloud is a great source to listen to all types of music. But sometimes, they will put 90% of my songs go +, meaning i have to have a subscription to listen to then. But eventually they give the songs back, they just try to trick you into buying the membership"
964,The best free music app,5,7/9/2022 19:32,You can listen to almost anything on this app for free without stupid restrictions like limited skips. There is also many leaks and underground songs that you will not find on other platforms.
965,"App is perfect, no issues at all!",5,5/27/2022 14:24,"I love SoundCloud so much it satisfied me, including the website. I’m happy with all the options it gives us. No errors, no troubles, 100% working fine and a smooth, painless experience!"
966,Update needs to be fixed!,1,6/13/2022 17:07,"This update at first was super cool & today it’s causing lots of issues. All my mixes are gone that I’ve posted, all my likes, all my playlists. It’s showing a new profile basically. I’ve tried deleting and re-downloading, got nothing. I tried logging out and back in, nothing. I’m going to be beyond upset if my mixes never come back on, because a lot of my hard work and growth will all be gone."
967,Ads Got Worse,4,6/13/2022 2:20,"Once again I love this this app, and the desktop version for my laptop but I got one question, why am I getting ads constantly? It didn’t used to be this bad till recently, I mean c’mon y’all losing money or something cause this is ridiculous."
968,App Crashing Issue,5,5/22/2022 20:53,"i love sound cloud deeply, recently a problem occurred where it’s completely unusable though. It crashes and closes the app out within a couple minutes."
969,Good but one bug,4,5/24/2022 16:56,"I love this app as an artist but there’s one bug I think should be addressed. 
Sometimes when someone comments on my song it doesn't show up on the comment page but it says I have one comment on my song. Plz address this issue thanks. :)"
970,They need to fix a lot.,2,2/22/2022 19:46,There’s many things they need to fix and put back. Like the groups. Every time my song ends it plays some person I went to check out like twice. I don’t want their stuff playing on my page after my music. There’s so much more they can add too. Just kind half @??ed. Like the free space they give you to upload though but...
971,Rarely recognizes songs,2,12/5/2021 1:18,"I can’t tell you how many times I’ve tried to I’d a song with this app and it fails to recognize it. I literally can’t since the app doesn’t keep track of how many failed attempts you’ve had. It doesn’t matter the source, radio, vinyl, or hearing a song out in the wild, it will rarely identify the track. It is good at playing ads though."
972,Best music app ever made,5,10/16/2021 6:55,You can literally listen to the future of music on this app. Listen to “ryguy” on SoundCloud to hear what the future of music is going to sound like. Other then that the app is just all around perfect.
973,"Love SC, but the app is only “okay”",3,11/12/2021 10:05,"You can’t even read messages in the app. Use the website… oh wait, you can’t read messages on the mobile website either? You have to go find a computer to read your messages? I’m trying to live an active life, not be sitting at my computer all the time."
974,Superior access for Independent artists,5,9/29/2021 16:59,Joined a group using SoundCloud for publication of their demos. Using it couldn’t be easier and the app remembers my searches so I don’t have spend time searching through large libraries.
975,It’s AMAZING,5,9/9/2021 21:10,I honestly really like it a lot but I do wish that you didn’t have to pay for some of the original versions of songs. otherwise it’s a really great app and I would recommend it to anyone
976,My Rating,5,8/29/2021 2:56,As an artist (Tamashii) I’d definitely rate this app 5 stars !!!! It’s useful and the analytics is a great way to keep track of which countries and areas listen to you most. With little to no adds I can enjoy my music too. Thank You SoundCloud
977,I can find most content,5,5/6/2021 12:35,I mostly use SoundCloud to upload my Beatz and my friends music and It’s very easy to find them because SoundCloud doesn’t bury new artists under the search well
978,great but lots of ads,3,7/24/2021 8:57,"I love Soundcloud i prefer it over any other music platform. However, I noticed that the more you use the app you start getting more and more ads. Sometimes i get an ad after one or two songs and it’s super annoying, Other than that I love this app, 3 stars for annoying ads."
979,I like this app but I cant keep all my favorite songs in my likes,4,7/4/2021 23:49,I love this song and i use it alot! But everytime i save a song over the number 92 tracks it doesnt save. Even if i get the song there when i close and re-open the app it isn’t there.
980,Way too many ads.,1,6/15/2021 4:34,"Back in 2013 this app was incredible. There were not ads, all the music was free, and great artists would post their new tracks and IDs here. Now though, I hear an ad after almost every second or third song. Sometimes I hear an ad after every other song. The platform just seems to slowly be going downhill. I am becoming less and less impressed with SoundCloud as the years go on."
981,Add,4,6/12/2021 12:44,This is a good and useful app but it almost every song I change to I have to have a add sometimes the double add and I know you have to make money too but a add almost every song is ridiculous I listen to more adds then music at this point
982,Help,5,4/7/2021 21:22,Everything’s been good until now it won’t let me edit my playlist it’s says connection failed but when I edit a different playlist it works plz fix
983,Keeping it REAL,5,3/27/2021 14:35,"Please do whatever it takes to keep this place what it’s intended for, REAL music 🎶 unfiltered, raw and heaven bound...#penniesfromheaven 🙏🏽✝️✅⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The IS a correlation between music 🎼 and the universe that holds us together as human beings, and the angelic beings that God has chosen to place on this very small world 🌎 🌍 🗺 📍 🎯 ❤️ #whosoevers"
984,best music app,5,12/4/2020 15:51,"I love core/rave music such as basscore,breakcore,etc. and there’s a lot to choose from on here so if your into that kinda sound this is the app for you... and if that isn’t you kinda music there is SO MUCH and I mean a lot of music to choose from."
985,One problem,4,3/22/2021 1:05,Having an issue where my “The Upload” playlist does not get updated at all. I have to delete and redownload the app for it to be refreshed. Hoping a bug fix will fix this? Been on soundcloud for ~5 years. Thanks!
986,Besides...,4,3/7/2021 18:28,"There’s so many reasons for the four stars, but as a individual who paid for pro unlimited I would like my insights to be actually accurate like it only shows plays nothing else not the repost, likes, and etc. Otherwise it’s 🔥."
987,Wish list,5,8/3/2020 18:29,"I’ve use this app meany times, The only probably I have know is when I shuffle my music it plays the same song, I have no way to choose what songs play next, I hope in the near future this will be fix."
988,Organizing playlists,3,11/28/2020 17:45,There should be a feature that makes it easier to rearrange your playlist. You should also be able to search for a song in your playlist. This is an important feature for people with large playlists.
989,"Wierd glitch or something (November 2nd, 2020)",3,11/2/2020 14:12,"There is a wierd “glitch” that happened today where none of the music loads and the two times i clicked the playlists that are made for you, some wierd election looking background comes up and the playlist is empty, now SoundCloud wont load music or open playlists
Please fix this"
990,Great app 1 big problem,3,8/8/2020 8:53,Every song that I listen to is now on SoundCloud go+ there’s no other app like SoundCloud that I can choose my songs without have to “shuffle play” it’s really annoying and I understand it’s for “business purposes” but give me a break literally all of my playlist is SoundCloud go+ come on man I can’t even use the app anymore.
991,Great but...,4,7/22/2020 18:00,"For about the last month or two the app has stayed on the initial loading screen. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but the last few updates has not fixed this issue. Otherwise it's one of my preferred apps to use for music."
992,Won’t play the next track,5,5/23/2020 3:08,"I have enjoyed using soundcloud for years now and that’s why I gave it 5 stars to be fair but I am having an issue now. Once a track is done, it won’t move to the next track. Is it only me or what?"
993,"Great app , but some bad things",4,7/11/2020 19:41,"i’m not even gon cap , this app is amazing . but sometimes i’ll just be in the car with my friends playing my music & so many ads come . like , how could you possibly put an ad after another ? i’m fine with an occasional ad but not constantly . soundcloud please fix this !!"
994,NEED UPLOAD  OPTION FOR IOS,5,3/23/2020 19:09,"This app is amazing I love it has all the music that I love but some of us don’t have a computer and we make upload our music to our  iOS devices but we can’t upload them because we need a computer,
  Please add upload option"
995,Playlist options,4,5/15/2020 21:21,Hey Soundcloud I love using this app but can you please add a playlist option. When I add a new song it gets put at the very bottom. Well can there be an option for where a new song gets added to the very top of a playlist please?
996,"Wonderful app, but",4,2/24/2020 13:22,"I’ve had this app for a good while now, but I have a complaint about how the songs play. In my favorites list, it often skips songs, sometimes even several songs at once. Please, if you’re able to find why it does this, fix it? Thanks in advance!"
997,Fantastic App for ios,5,3/23/2022 3:50,"I think this app is best for ios as we can like a song or add to the playlist after that we can also listen it offline & also by locking phone.
10/10"
998,Upload problems,3,8/30/2022 2:58,I love this app I have been using it for a while.. I just don’t like how I upload something but then it gets taken down after I leave the app. I have been having that problem for a while now and it bothers me. I don’t post anything bad I just post music such as 3D audios or slowed/reverb songs.
999,New Update,1,6/17/2022 21:29,I had SoundCloud for a while and with the new update changing the colors and everything I thought it ruined it. The green was just a small indicator to show u downloaded it and it was much simpler and better then the new one. The like went from white to orange to blank to white which is kind of confusing since white was first shown to show didn’t like the song. I like everything else except the color scheme
1000,Xx,4,6/17/2022 1:20,"Long time user here. I’m all for the new update and what not, but can we please have the feature to delete history and clear the artist/playlist we’ve listened to? Would’ve been a 5 but my profile is starting to get a lil messy lol (at least for me)"
1001,I get a lot of pleasure on Sound Cloud making songs.,5,8/7/2021 5:55,"It’s is very nice to hear others music, get fans, and be able to make friends along the way. Sound Cloud is superb app All respect to it maker from me to you"
1002,One to many ads,4,9/23/2021 6:26,This would be a perfect app for streaming music but there is to many ads you’ll get one after like 2 or 3 songs which can get pretty annoying but besides that I highly recommend downloading
1003,Amazing app,5,1/25/2021 13:08,"I’ve used SoundCloud for 2 weeks on my phone and I love it! It’s great for playing music, uploading music, and seeing what artists are up to. I would totally recommend this app to everyone who likes music."
1004,Why is it not letting me sign in?,1,5/16/2021 8:54,"I tired to sign in with my app account but it said there was a error, so then I tired to sign in with my app account 5 more times and it didn’t work, so I tired my to sign in with my google account and there was a error, I tired to sign in 5 more times, there was a error, I close my application and open it back up, I did the same thing and there was a error, so I don’t know why it’s not letting me sign up."
1005,Amazing app,5,1/22/2021 21:39,This is amazing i can listen to songs that aren’t even out yet and can create a playlist with an unlimited amount of songs would recommend soundcloud if you want to vibe
1006,Amazing,5,11/10/2020 21:52,"As a music producer and a music listener, SoundCloud has become a great place to find new artists and release songs and build a following! Highly recommend SoundCloud to anyone who wants to listen to new people!"
1007,"Honestly, not bad",5,11/7/2020 15:02,"Yeah, I get it. There’s ads. However the content library is far more vast than any other streaming platform, and the paid version makes it that much better."
1008,There are 2 glitches that keep happening to me.,5,10/1/2020 5:16,The app works great but sometimes my account just randomly logs out and sometimes soundcloud just crashes when I open it.
1009,iOS 14 Issue.,5,9/27/2020 1:15,"Just updated and everytime I play a song, it’ll play the first second and then stop. It’ll keep saying that the song is playing but no sound will play."
1010,What I think,5,8/30/2020 15:06,I really like SoundCloud the one thing is that you can’t listen offline you have to have internet. You used to be able to but then y’all updated it and now you have to pay to listen offline.
1011,Love it,5,7/2/2020 17:12,I love how you can find almost every song on here instead of like just song you would hear on the radio I got rid of pandora on my phone for sound cloud because I’m to poor to get premium so yea I recommend it
1012,The new changes have ruined it for me,2,8/23/2020 16:17,"SoundCloud used to be the only music app I used for listening whether I was at the gym, at home relaxing, skating around, at school, or on the bus. 

But now they’re making like 90% of the songs made by official creators on the app only available with SoundCloud GO Plus, so all the songs I had in playlists and played on repeat for years, are only previews now. 

Really disappointing SoundCloud"
1013,I liked it...at first,3,7/15/2020 0:33,At first this app seemed good I was able to get the songs I wanted and it seemed awesome but it says it works offline so when I went to the store I decided to Listen to some music but in the middle of my song it just cut out and I couldn’t fix it if there’s something I’m missing please let me know because I’m not sure if it was just a glitch or what
1014,Really good for people to get their voice heard,5,6/14/2020 16:39,this app is so good for people who are interested in putting their voice out there or if you want music it’s better than other platforms due to the facts you can play songs on demand
1015,my favorite music app but...,3,6/27/2020 6:35,"If we have to sit thru 30 second non skip ads every 2-3 songs at least give us access to all songs instead of have most as Go+ also the pop up that tells us to upgrade every time we open the app is extremely annoying, it doesn’t inspire me to upgrade it does the complete opposite."
1016,The Inman Pareli review,5,5/13/2020 23:36,SC is one of the best apps as far as music publishing go’s I love it to be honest and will always recommend it to anyone that is in the music business or trying to get in it. Just wish I had a way to get the word out a little more about me being on there.😏💙💯
1017,Premium SoundCloud,2,6/12/2020 15:26,"I’ve been listing to soundcloud for a long time now, but why’d you guys make pretty much everything premium, is kind of dumb, yeah ok you guys are gonna try to make more money or something, but like I can’t listen to anything now I have to delete SoundCloud because I can’t really pay for SoundCloud right now, don’t really want to honestly, should’ve stayed free, not gonna start paying for it now it’s just absurd."
1018,"Good, but...",4,3/23/2020 20:40,"The app is good, I can listen to any song I want and it’s easy to use. But now I don’t know of it’s a glitch because it happened before but I need soundcloud go in order to listen to the songs I used to listen. What’s worse is that it’s literally almost every song. Please change this"
1019,Could be better,3,2/15/2020 12:15,See I was just looking through one of my playlists that I listen to everyday then I saw all of them you have to have a membership for and my family does not have the money for it like I get they want people to get it but you could at least let people have more then like 3 songs thank you for reading good bye💛💛
1020,VERY WELL,5,6/16/2022 16:20,I am quite satisfied with this app. It has sooo many songs other apps do not have. Would definitely recommend if you especially like nightcore as well. 10/10 very well enjoyed.
1021,Issue,4,9/2/2022 1:34,"Great app, i use it daily but today i logged off to make a acc for my friends and when i went to log back on i couldnt. It said my log in didn’t exist, it also gave me the option to make a new account, i didnt delete the account so i dont know."
1022,Good app,4,8/14/2022 22:45,I love this app it lets me listen to everything but there is one small problem when I try to shuffle play my playlist it sends me to SoundCloud go+ I think the app thinks I have a go+ song on my playlist but I don’t can you please fix this thanks
1023,PLEASE FIX!!,4,7/19/2022 14:28,I am experiencing a issue where I can’t remove certain tracks from recently played. And when I followed your buyers instruction the function for removing the playlists only works for my playlists and not the ones I want. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!! (Other than that it’s good)
1024,Good but fix it please,5,6/5/2022 8:56,I love SoundCloud and use it every day but recently the music stops and the app closes and I can’t even look at recent songs or my listening history please fix
1025,new app looks nice but lacks features from web UI,3,6/11/2022 22:49,"it’s important to have the artist-posted track descriptions because there’s usually good info, links, etc. and the app is also missing release dates for tracks which is crucial. the app also uses battery almost as bad as snapchat."
1026,It’s okay with the New One,4,6/11/2022 20:29,"I’m kind of upset with the “New” SoundCloud, the old one is what I’m more used too, I’m just upset that this “New” one is now here and the old one I got used to it in a flash, but this new update I can’t really get used too it, but I’d say I am “sort of” used to this."
1027,SoundCloud,5,2/2/2022 20:06,I love this there are different versions of one song and it’s so much better and easier than like pandora and there are less ads and how it’s free for a broke person like me
1028,Please fix soundcloud sign in function,3,4/30/2022 19:56,"I have using soundcloud for avery long time and i truly love using it but for some reason i try signing in with facebook it doesn't work and i have no way to retrieve my account, i've try signing in both in app and website but neither of them work."
1029,From Jayzex86,5,10/30/2021 19:22,Thank you SoundCloud for posting my music for FREE! 😎 I love you guys so much. I wouldn’t change anything. Please don’t forget to like and share my music. Pain of Love- OUT NOW!!!! 😁 I would like like to thank all my supporters and fans. I love you guys. 💯💙
1030,Equalizer!,2,1/26/2022 1:53,This is an amazing app but it bothers me that the app is limited to regular audio. Years later and we still don’t have a built in equalizer. I’m sure most users have no choice but to use another app in order to take full advantage of the better audio. I will have no problem changing this to 5 stars if they can implement something so small like an equalizer.
1031,Like not working,5,10/19/2021 6:57,Love the app love the music. Paying for the service please fix the likes button songs not being saved to library. App also crashing. Please fix.
1032,Coming in clutch,5,10/2/2021 15:11,Always has the songs from artists that you tend to not be able to find anywhere else.
1033,SoundCloud,5,9/3/2021 0:19,This is such a good app to listen to music to when studying or doing class work I definitely would recommend downloading if you are trying to focus in your classes
1034,Great!!!,5,6/23/2021 7:05,"I love this app I can make playlists of all of the beats I made thats in my drive, but the one thing I don’t like is that you can’t move songs around on your playlists, all around amazing app though!!!"
1035,As a,5,6/9/2021 22:38,"musician, this place is a gem for us folks just trying to get out there or even a place for the misfits who don’t wanna walk the line and their listeners.  I will 100% put my album on SoundCloud when I’m finished with it. Thank you, guys! -Louie O. Blevins"
1036,Amazing app,5,5/15/2021 14:28,I’ve been using sound cloud for about 1 year and I’ve used so many other music apps and SoundCloud has by far been the only one to have everything I’m looking for
1037,Great for beginners,5,4/29/2021 15:04,"So I’ve always wanted to be a DJ and I ended up finding this app SoundCloud, I used it and ended up liking it. and people can follow you and like your sounds repost your audio.
So I give it a five stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Also if you want my SoundCloud account it’s
LIL KELL"
1038,Best app for music just one problem,5,8/9/2020 2:31,"Hey, I use SoundCloud every day of my life but I just have a problem with self promoters they just ruin the app I know u can’t do anything about it but I thought I would say something about bc I know tons of ppl who wanna stop self promoters"
1039,Analytics issue,3,11/26/2020 0:51,Please please please bring SoundCloud pulse back the SoundCloud application doesn’t update the analytics at all I’ve been looking at the same analytics for 2 weeks when my plays etc. is going up tremendously I want to use this analytic info for more promo ideas but I can’t do that when it’s not accurate
1040,Ads,3,10/3/2020 12:29,Love the soundcloud app but when it tells me i have to wait for 2 30 second ads id rather kms the listen to the ads every 3 songs. Please remove ads or atleast make them so there only 1 short ad and not as often. Would make your app 10/10 if you did that but as of now its a 6/10.
1041,Fix this bug,5,3/26/2020 14:10,Soundcloud is straight but y’all need to stop giving us 2 adds at the same time and fix this bug of when I like a song it unlikes it and when I unlike a song it relikes it please fix this bug
1042,"Solid, but one major complaint.",4,7/26/2020 5:39,"My question is: why do you have video ads on a MUSIC SERVICE!? It’s annoying, they don’t keep playing when I exit the app, and most of the time I can’t skip them. Could you remove these ads from your app, please, to make it easier for all of us?"
1043,Can’t log back in after a random auto-logout,3,7/24/2020 14:18,"So I had kept music playing overnight as I had left it then about 8 hours later I go back to SoundCloud and then I get kicked from the app and get signed out and tried google thinking if I got hacked so google was the option and it said error, so I tried without google and it said no account existed"
1044,Limited amount of tracks per playlist:(,4,7/14/2020 4:08,"I love SoundCloud and am subscribed to SoundCloud go however I am disappointed that there can only be 500 tracks on one playlist. I love long playlists and I’ve noticed other music apps do not have a limit like this, please remove the limit!!:)"
1045,Issues with syncing on tv,3,6/28/2020 16:50,I’ve used SoundCloud for years but these last few months i have to remove the app completely to download again in order for my songs to play on my tv. But even then it wouldn’t be the specific song that i won’t. Not sure when it’ll be fixed but hopefully its soon
1046,Terrible App For Musicians,2,6/1/2020 22:44,"I don’t know who the target audience is here but it’s definitely not designed for creators. The UI is not intuitive and seems designed to get you listening to music not sharing it. 

The dealbreaker for me was forcing 30 second ads in the middle of me trying to organize and delete tracks. I have a hard time believing all the positive reviews, the website was a better experience for me."
1047,"SoundCloud is the best app, but..",5,3/9/2020 15:45,"Actually, if you can put back the shuffle, play, pause and the playlist menu option it will be great if IOS System have this option..

Also, the app doesn’t let me comment either"
1048,Soundcloud is my Go-To,5,1/27/2020 19:05,"I love me my music. Some Ads are funny, but most are whack. Give us our choice to skip within 5 or 7 seconds at least. How about adding like a “friends feed” where you can tune into your friends recent posts."
1049,"Long time user, first time reviewer",5,1/16/2020 5:57,"The platform itself has been a tremendous resource for independent artists. Cultures, styles, and movements have been birthed, spawned, evolved and died because of this service.

Though the app leaves a lot to be desired, it’s still a powerful resource for audiences and artist alike."
1050,It’s a good music app but....,3,1/26/2020 4:48,So I’ve been using SoundCloud for awhile now and it’s been running smoothly but recently it’s been lagging out running real slow and I have SoundCloud go so I can listen to my music offline and then now every time I try to click on my playlists it just crashes. I restarted my phone and closed the app but it still does that
1051,"Great, however...",4,1/22/2020 2:03,"SoundCloud is an amazing app, has fantastic sound quality and everything, but why are (almost) all my songs by P!atd moved to SoundCloud Go+? Same goes for the songs by Alec Benjamin... not liking it at all... like it’s actually giving me anxiety because I can’t listen to them... makes me sad."
1052,The app,5,3/18/2022 5:37,I’ve used SoundCloud across both platforms and I have to say the iOS experience is pleasant.  I want to try go for free so I know for sure because honestly I’m getting a lot out of this account.
1053,Complaint,4,9/2/2022 0:50,I’ve been using for about 3 years and it’s been fine all the time but after this last update they have messed all my playlists it has glitched and deleted nearly everything
1054,Update Issues,3,6/14/2022 0:39,"The newest version won’t load and has issues. Ironically the update was to fix bug issues but this version won’t load any playlists to play. It displays an unexpected thing occurred and showed retry but when I retry it doesn’t work. Upsetting since I love using the app, but can’t now."
1055,Crashing,5,3/12/2021 20:01,On the Xbox one version of SoundCloud it crashes after playing a couple of songs please fix it it’s started to get annoying
1056,Just one (probably fixable) problem,4,3/11/2022 0:38,"I love the app HOWEVER, I would like to be able to rename playlists without having to sign in elsewhere, that’s the only issue I have this this app (other than the lack of an EQ, which is more of a personal preference)"
1057,AD SPAMMING,3,12/1/2021 1:00,"you know, im really tired of seeing ads all the time,first,it was every 4 songs,and now its a track between ads!Oml just stop with the ads for one second!Cant i just draw and listen to music in peace?!?!Now your just pushing me to buy your stuff,and that’s pushing me to deleting the app! another bad review for the internet!🤠"
1058,Great,5,2/11/2021 14:47,You can listen to music and do whatever you want I just recommend if your going to type to turn off the sound of texting
1059,Amazing App,5,12/20/2020 14:51,"I love this app because you can either pay or free listen music, I been using this app for about 4-5 years ago I never had a single issue I hope SoundCloud continue this way."
1060,Keeps getting deleted,4,2/6/2021 3:55,It keeps getting removed from my phone. Not the apps fault it’s apples. The app only supports Version 13+ software. On older phones we don’t have Version 13. Very annoying and now I can’t download an older version of the app.
1061,Awesome c:,5,10/7/2020 1:31,It almost had every song in there and it’s just very relaxing especially when you have a hard to sleeping just out music I think it’s great when am in a road trip it helps a lot yea It’s very awesome c:
1062,Accessibility problems,3,10/18/2020 3:43,"i’d probably find myself using this app a whole lot more if it weren’t for one thing: SoundCloud does not even come close to working with screen readers. I use voiceover on my phone, and it doesn't read off almost anything in the app, which makes navigating it a nightmare."
1063,Can you fix the ads please,3,9/25/2020 6:02,Why did you remove the option to skip ads 15 seconds through them I’m so tired of the same ads over and over again without being able to skip them like I get it Verizon is cool now let me listen to my vocaloid songs in peace
1064,SoundCloud,3,9/10/2020 18:47,"Soundcloud is honestly amazing, like there’s a bunch of songs to listen on their. I just don’t like the ads that much you never are able to skip them and there 30 seconds long. I just don’t like how I’m doing something and then like two ads pop out and it’s pretty annoying."
1065,I love it but...,2,7/29/2020 23:31,"I love the concept of the app and everything, but I have a problem with the app as well, when an ad comes up they constantly play the say vape drug ads, and when a video ad comes on I have to watch it the whole way and when I go to a different app the video stops... it doesn’t make sense to me, it’s like y’all are forcing us to watch these videos when half of us doesn’t wants to."
1066,Awesome suggestions,5,3/6/2020 2:49,I love the SoundCloud weekly suggestions they’re something you can’t miss!! Some of the best sounds from the most underground unheard of people out there! So you can tell your friends aye I put you on that guy before he even had 1k listens and it’s so fun!
1067,Soundcloud Go+,1,6/11/2020 7:10,"I understand some songs are only for SoundCloud Go+ members but I do NOT  understand how now mostly the majority of songs are now only for SoundCloud Go+ when they were not before, I can’t listen to any songs I was previously able to and pretty much all my songs I liked are now changed to SoundCloud Go +. At the very least fix it to where not every artist with a little popularity gets Go+ because this is now become ridiculous 😤😪"
1068,Stopped working..,1,5/1/2020 17:32,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for over a year now and I was listening to my music no issues just last night and now almost more than half of them are only previews of the songs and it says to get go+ for full version. I get money needs to be made and I would’ve had no problem paying for a subscription to get no adds and what not but for it to just change like that?! Unbelievable, I’m deleting this app now."
1069,Some issues,3,4/27/2020 17:01,"Lately (started this month and I have the latest update) SoundCloud won’t let me add any songs to existing playlists. It will only let me turn the song into a new playlist, and none of my playlists are at capacity either! Frustrating problem when trying to organize songs"
1070,The adds,3,4/19/2020 6:49,Sound cloud really all the adds on how people smoke and all the other things little kids use this and it freaks me out all the adds about how it can mess us up I think we all know if people do it they do it it’s their fault to what happens to then ever action has an good thing or an good thing plz if you gonna do adds plz not those kinda adds
1071,Sound Cloud,5,1/14/2020 20:11,"This is a top notch app, I’ve been discovering new music every day with their platform. Super easy to use. I’m a old guy and not to savvy with today’s technology, but I have no problem with Sound Cloud. Straight forward, highly recommend this app 👍🏼 Steve A."
1072,Questionable Glitch,2,1/6/2020 13:12,"There seems to be a glitch for my iPad where I am stuck on just playing songs and I can’t play playlists or albums. Whenever I select a new playlist to start or even a song within a playlist, SoundCloud just plays the last song I had selected to start, with the beginning of the old song starting at 0:00 of what I actually want to listen to."
1073,Great! Until..,4,6/16/2022 6:14,"I was listening to music like normal, and someone called me through discord. Ever since then, my music has been cutting out for no reason whatsoever. I can’t get past 1 second of a song without it cutting out for the rest of the song."
1074,One of the best music platforms ever,5,6/15/2022 19:21,Great user interface. Great music. Most potential for everyone. This app is not like others. It’s unique and I honestly can’t stress how much amazing random music I have found. It’s a community.
1075,The best music app definitely worth your time,5,5/31/2022 18:54,It is a very good app it has all of my favorite songs I have had for a while now it is my favorite music app definitely recommend
1076,Update? Where,1,6/13/2022 15:50,"This new update is absolute garbage. When I open this app, if I tap on any button whatsoever the entire thing freezes & proceeds to crash. If I try to go back into the app and do it all over again, the cycle repeats. I can’t even get as far as my profile or liked tracks without my screen becoming useless, and i’ve never had this problem in the 8 years i’ve been using this app"
1077,Glitching,5,4/6/2022 20:00,"I am unable to rearrange songs in my playlist. When I  click on edit playlist, the 3 horizontal lines on the right hand corner of the screen does not show.  What’s up?"
1078,Best music app ever (recommend),5,1/10/2022 18:23,I’ve had sound cloud for 4 YEARS and it is so good and easy all my favorite songs on this app I can even make my own music! So I definitely really really recommend this app
1079,Minute long ads ?!?!??,2,3/8/2022 2:26,Y’all say you update the app to keep it running smooth . But I see y’all slowing down the app forcing us to update it for longer and more frequent ads in between songs . Gets really annoying when we can’t even skip the ads now . Something needs to change before I change my music platform.
1080,Pretty good,5,12/22/2021 0:10,Everything is great barely any ads only problem is some songs requires their pro version  which is a little annoying
1081,Thank you SoundCloud,5,12/20/2021 12:42,I love SoundCloud it’s the best music app I can have it helped me build my playlist pick songs that I like and everything so thank you SoundCloud and if u don’t have SoundCloud you need to get it now
1082,Can't upload anything,5,11/9/2021 23:24,Why can't I upload anything on my SoundCloud no more I've been trying to upload my new songs and I can't upload anything
1083,Issues after the new update,3,12/13/2021 2:41,"Whenever I’ve used SoundCloud before the recent update, it would work fine. After the app updated, I have not been able to go to any artists page. The artists profile page never loads even when I restart the app."
1084,Resume play,4,11/17/2021 15:39,"Can you please resume the song I was currently playing when restarting the app? I listen to long mixes and lime to pick up where I left off when restarting the app, sometimes after a few days."
1085,Sound cloud,5,4/12/2021 0:07,I love it it is great to use to listen to music but if there where no ads that would make it so much better cause I just can stand that all new things have so much ads
1086,Can’t unlike certain songs BUG,4,6/25/2021 16:22,"When you unlike a song, it turns grey for a few seconds, then automatically relikes the song. Can’t remove certain songs from my likes playlist!"
1087,An amazing music app!,4,6/14/2021 2:40,"Hello, If I had to begin this, this is a really good app for listening to music that has fairly any errors that need to be added or removed. For example, there should be a option to repeat the music that you love to listen the most to. Overall, I LOVE SOUNDCLOUD!!!"
1088,Decent app,4,5/28/2021 10:42,"I like how you can play out of the app, however I don’t like that it doesn’t have every song available when I search for a specific song and it’s not there. The layout is decent just not as good as Spotify’s layout."
1089,It’s a great app for music,5,3/19/2021 1:26,It’s good because it doesn’t give you so many ads like after every song it waits for at least 20 to 30 minutes to pop an add on you
1090,Great music platform!,5,2/19/2021 18:26,"Soundcloud is a really awesome music community where artists can share their own music and you can also find other musicians, bands, and creators expressing their sonic artwork on the canvas of airwaves that colors the ears of their listeners!"
1091,I love this app,5,2/9/2021 17:30,I love this app because of how you can work on other things and choose the songs you want without many adds when you play them.
1092,You can listen to the song you want,5,1/22/2021 16:12,"No having to listen to something else first, listen to what you want to right now, open another window stil listening WORD!"
1093,Idk a review?,3,12/5/2020 13:34,"Why does it require iOS 13.0 or newer? Why? Is there any legitimate reason for this? If so I’d really enjoy knowing what this reason is. Otherwise good enough, ads are sometimes really annoying, and why don’t playlists loop? Perhaps I overlooked an option to loop playlists but I’m fairly certain that there is not one."
1094,Sound cloud,5,11/13/2020 19:26,sound cloud is a very good app for me to listen to my favorite music and when i am doing thing’s like homework i can listen to my music without my phone having yo be turned on
1095,Happy moments,5,11/7/2020 11:29,"SoundCloud offers a great distraction when time out is needed. There is always something there to fill a void, help make getting a difficult task done or just offer a bit of relaxation!"
1096,Jack.H,5,9/22/2020 17:35,"I’ve been listening to SoundCloud for years and there is no better music app out there it’s very simple, has any song you want, and you can make your own playlist"
1097,Highly recommend,5,5/26/2020 20:58,"I love this app, I highly recommend you to download it. It have majority of the songs on her and plus you’re able to listen to music while on another app which helps you focus❤️"
1098,SoundCloud,4,8/15/2020 2:32,"App is cool..literally if you listen to the song you can listen to it later with no WiFi without SoundCloud go and the ads are short not even that bad app is pretty good
Aye but uh I hate the fact that the ads pause because I’m not on the app watching it that needs to change"
1099,Can’t stop using!,5,4/25/2020 12:00,"Doesn’t have the songs I look for sometimes but, I found some of my favourite songs on this app. 10/10 highly recommend"
1100,"Good content, Terrible app",2,5/4/2020 16:27,"I use this app for podcasts because they keep casters older catalogs up. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t use it. 

The app itself is horrible, constant crashing, no ability to skip forward or backwards a few seconds, anytime you pause a track it crashes as soon as you press play again, really slow buffering."
1101,Good way too listen too music,5,3/30/2020 8:18,"Soundcloud is a great app for listening to your favorite songs and has very low amounts of ads, you may get one every few songs but it’s usually a 15 second ad so you can practically ignore it."
1102,Definitely install,5,1/3/2020 5:01,One thing I don’t like about other music apps is that there is so many adds it is almost impossible to listen to music without being interrupted by adds. I’m very impressed with the app.
1103,Love this music app!,5,9/2/2022 3:36,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for awhile now. I love hearing what people have uploaded and hearing original content! Also, in my opinion if you’re able to afford it, it’s worth upgrading to SoundCloud Go+."
1104,Best free music app 🥹🥹hands down 👌🏽👌🏽,5,8/13/2022 8:18,"Almost anything you want to hear with the ability to back ground listen without having to pay for a subscription 😯😲🤌🏽

No pure music app comes close 🤞🏾"
1105,Good but content not the best,5,8/11/2022 15:50,"Some of the content can be explicit. It’s hard to not see explicit stuff, even when you are shooting for clean music. There needs to be a filter button"
1106,My rate,5,7/11/2022 7:38,I am saying this music app is the best out there! Like there is no other! This app differs from the rest of these higher end music download platforms. And everything stays on your SoundCloud! It’s amazing !
1107,Def recommended !,5,6/2/2022 21:26,"I love this app, but one thing I don’t like is that some songs include the premium thing. And I can’t listen to my fav songs 💀 Most Songs that are rlly famous aren’t available. But overall it’s lit so good !"
1108,Too many bugs/ recent update 👎🏾,1,6/18/2022 17:10,"With the recent update that changed how the app looks, and haven’t been able to load profiles, my playlist or albums. Very frustrating please do something to fix these problems. Main issue is the playlist I’ve made over the years not even loading when I go to the playlist option in the main menu."
1109,💔,3,6/18/2022 2:14,"New update makes it crash way too often :( almost after every other song which is frustrating when I’m driving lol. Please give us the option of switching back to the old UI - it felt way more comfortable to use. 

Sincerely
A SoundCloud Go customer since 2018 <3"
1110,everything,2,6/13/2022 13:45,SoundCloud Crashed more in past week than I’ve ever had any other app crash ever combined. The amount of times my liked songs don’t even exist is ridiculous. Nothing loads. There’s a Consistent 2-3 crashes every time I’m listening to a song. Ui switches back and forth between old and new every time I reload the app. Losing my daym mind
1111,GIVE US THE ABILITY TO LIKE COMMENTS!!,5,4/21/2022 17:56,it would be an amazing feature to give us artists the option to like comments and react more to them! engaging with our fans is one of the best parts of this job!
1112,Easy to use and find other peoples’ music.,5,1/5/2022 16:15,I like how easy it is to upload your own music or podcasts and how you can leave comments on time stamps on songs.
1113,Just This one thing,4,2/25/2022 17:50,"I love SoundCloud been using it for three years now.
But my one issue is, ive used a samsung for most of my time here, switched to an iphone a little ago and noticed there were no options to get the description"
1114,Not great for creators,2,2/14/2022 15:11,"The app is awesome for listeners but is still missing some basic features like being able to read descriptions for tracks. 

Reading descriptions is a great way to learn more about specific tracks and better connect with artists. 

As a creator, not having access to the inbox messaging feature is a huge problem."
1115,Love it,5,6/17/2021 22:38,If I could change anything it would be a dislike button to steer clear of certain types of tracks.
1116,Cant sign in,3,12/4/2021 21:25,I’ve been with SoundCloud for a little while now and always had a account but the thing is now I got kicked out my account and won’t let me sign back in even though I have the right email and right password but just won’t let me sign in for some reason.
1117,Poor experience,1,11/2/2021 6:00,"I used SoundCloud for YEARS, until one day found than 80% of music I like is “not available for your country”. Just like that. And I know I’m not alone with that, people writing similar stories on the web. I really upset with such decision, I’m not going to back, even if you turn it on again, because I don’t trust you anymore. I hope you’ll lost all of your audience who LOVED this service for years."
1118,My account is gone.,4,5/17/2021 18:48,Hello so I had this account that had so many amazing songs that is now gone and I’m pretty mad about that but SoundCloud is still amazing and would recommend using for songs that are not released anywhere else😊
1119,It is a great app for music,5,3/1/2021 13:33,I love it first off it comes with no ads so straight into the song you can also comment which is pretty cool and so far everything is free but I still have to see
1120,Ads be too much.,3,3/25/2021 18:30,"I lovee SoundCloud and always have but I regret updating so much, I  get ads now I can’t play two songs without getting an ad and they’re always really irritating. The excessive amount of ads makes it the music app I use the least sadly:/ it used to be my #1. Ads killing the app for me."
1121,Music,5,1/25/2021 17:52,I rlly like this app you can listen to any song you want if there small artists and big ones as well they make song remix and slow the song I rate this app a 5 star love it
1122,Links don’t work,1,2/21/2021 0:00,"Downloaded the app so I could listen to a playlist someone linked to me. The playlist opens in the browser, I hit “Listen in App”, and it opens the App Store, which has an “Open” button since the app is already downloaded. “Open” takes me to the app, but not the playlist, which I can’t find by searching. No matter how I try the steps i always wind up in the app without the linked playlist."
1123,One of the BEST music platforms to date!,5,1/2/2021 19:19,After being around for quite a some time SoundCloud still takes the cake as one of the best streaming platforms to date!
1124,Best free hometown music ever,5,2/4/2020 23:59,If you are from a developing country trying to follow the trend of your home country music you are in the right place. It’s a platform that offers artists of all categories the opportunity to share their art with listeners in an supportive way.
1125,Fix song reuploads,3,8/21/2020 23:44,"For literally 4 years, I’ve had to delete and download the app again in order to listen to a private track with a replaced file (I’m assuming this happens with public tracks too). I’m so absolutely sick of this, if I don’t do it, I only hear the old version of the file. I’ve seen countless people talk about it, please fix it."
1126,Can’t even login,1,7/30/2020 5:51,"I constantly get an error trying to sign into the app. I cannot create or sign in using the email I created my account with on the app. I can only sign in online using a browser.

I think it’s because I signed up with my gmail email through google and then removed it.

A real bummer to have this problem. I can’t even use the website on my phone because it forces me to use the app that I cannot even sign into. What an epic fail."
1127,Almost no free listening,1,7/18/2020 4:38,All my music that was already in a playlist before needing to buy the premium subscription is screwed up now because that’s most of my playlist not I only get little previews because they decided to make it to where you have to pay why should I have to pay for a premium that does nothing for the actual artist to sit here and relax to music I like what happened to being free to play music kind of app
1128,Cry for money,3,7/3/2020 18:44,"I personally like this app. It has good music and you can upload whatever you want really. But the fact there’s a limit to how many songs you can upload? Really man? Why not just let people do what they want? You already advertise plus everywhere, I think this is just a cry for more money at this point."
1129,Slow,2,6/22/2020 9:06,"The app in painfully slow and broken. I try to search up songs and it slows my whole phone down and I have a iPhone 7. Sometimes I’ll close the app and it’ll still be playing the song. There’s also ads u can’t just listen to,  like you have to watch the video and it always after the first song u listen to."
1130,I love SoundCloud,5,1/5/2020 4:17,"When ever I listen to music it’s louder and I can go to music quicker and I like it when I turn off my phone and still listen to music and when I’m playing games I can still listen to music.

Thank you for the app ❤️"
1131,Really good,5,6/13/2022 20:34,The only thing right now new update removed shuffle button from playlists so you gotta tap three dots for that. Could you bring it back
1132,Delete A repost,4,7/27/2022 20:00,"Hi I love the app everything’s great and I appreciate all the hard work, but I would like to delete a repost On app and I can’t seem to find it if it is there. Please support group let the coding team know I would really appreciate it , much love and have a great day -"
1133,I love it but there’s a glitch-,4,6/18/2022 15:25,"Well I love SoundCloud but I can only use it on my computer, whenever I go on my phone for it, it stops a little bit into the song and then restarts it.  I already updated SoundCloud so I’m not sure what’s happening!"
1134,Try again error,5,6/13/2022 15:09,Evertime I go into soundcloud since the update it says try again ya need to fix this cause it's my main music platform so do something about it now please🙏🏽
1135,Good app but doesn’t update until late,5,4/30/2022 22:15,Whenever I update the app it bounces back to an update from a few days ago after I already updated it
1136,Ads,3,6/1/2022 5:28,"I really love this app. It’s aloud me to listen to great music, and new music/remixes. But after a year of me using it, the amount of ads went up 4 or 5 times more. It used to maybe be one every 50 songs or something. It ruins the experience a little bit. There’s an ad every other song."
1137,Liking songs doesn’t work,2,5/25/2022 3:39,Every time i like a song it immediately unlikes itself. I thought i was able to solve this needless issue by quickly liking the song twice so that it shows up in my library but every time i refresh the app the song disappears. This problem is RIDICULOUS and needs to be fixed.
1138,The best music app you should get!,5,3/26/2022 11:55,I gonna be honest some of the original music I like is not in my country yet that really makes me kinda bummed out but they have custom music from online artists that’s really cool. ;)
1139,Good for kpop/ kpop covers,5,3/13/2022 19:41,So far this app has been wonderful! I have not found a single mistake in it! The ads are also manageable and it works without WiFi if you have it on <3 Make sure to check it out Bye Army Moas Engenes Moomoo’s Midzys Etc
1140,It’s a good tool,3,3/13/2022 21:51,Could be a little more user friendly over the phone and subscriptions are buggy on phone sometimes. I tried renewing on one profile and some how set up a new profile with the subscription. Can’t merge accounts. Probably for good reason but it would be nice.
1141,Please Read,5,11/1/2021 20:11,i dont know what’s going on but few times every month it would sign me out and it would take like 30 mins to log back in
1142,Offline is terrible - has sync loading issues.,4,1/26/2022 18:10,The track list really needs to be cached so if you are offline or the backend is slow you can still get a track listing.  A stale state is better than no state. :(
1143,Garbage,1,12/13/2021 17:47,"This app is garbage the only thing I like is you can upload music free. I got it on my Xbox to and it is garbage it crashes all the time it crashes for no reason it crashes when you pause the music don’t bother getting it on Xbox. It’s okay on mobile but it still doesn’t sound good. You also have to pay for there stupid member ship to listen to some songs. 
So don’t even bother getting this app"
1144,great source to store and content,5,7/26/2021 15:54,"I had been looking for certain sermons, longform, that are hard to find that I can’t or don’t want to pay for right now. SoundCloud took care of that"
1145,Awesome app,5,4/23/2021 18:44,"I bought this app a year ago, it has exceeded my expectations. It’s awesome! There are a few kinks here and there, like sometimes “the upload” playlist you get usually daily isn’t Changing."
1146,Great App,5,3/25/2021 2:47,The app is nice but the ads take less time to get on but the ad doesn’t get on the songs by I don’t have the premium but the app is mostly like it doesn’t have ads but you guys do
1147,Like the clarity,5,1/8/2021 14:20,"The app is easy to use. I was surprised that you can listen to
The podcast on your smartTV bcuz you can cast it when you use chrome cast. But the podcast is broadcasted clearly. Refreshing to hear."
1148,#NAME?,3,3/13/2021 21:10,I like supporting independent artists but some of my suggestions are terrible and there’s no way for me to keep them from playing after a track I like. It’s gotten to the point where I just switch to another music app after I’m done listening to a track.
1149,.,4,3/7/2021 0:12,This app is great it was the only music app I used buh I think imma stop it’s really taking off some of my favorite songs and it says this song isn’t available in your country like gmfu 😭🙄 or songs I was listening to yesterday I can’t no more all bad smh
1150,Good app,5,11/7/2020 23:54,Great app if you play music a lot like I do it’s really good I barley ever get adds and I love I can go into other apps and music can still me playing even if my phone is off it plays so that’s something I really love
1151,One thing is wrong,4,12/14/2020 3:14,The app is really good but one this is everytime I go into another app my music that is playing from SoundCloud will automatically lower itself and then when I go back into SoundCloud it plays normal. Please fix this.
1152,Review,5,10/24/2020 18:25,Great way to get your name out there and your sound heard. Sound cloud is amazing because it has all types of genres. to appeal to any listener and mater age or cultural! I love the user friendly platform and easy access!
1153,Bug Fixing to do,5,9/27/2020 7:36,"I’m liking the music but it just doesn’t want to like it. When I press the like button, it won’t let me like it or save into my library. Please fix this."
1154,App keeps crashing,5,7/17/2020 5:26,"I love the app and I’ve used you for a year I like, the annoying thing is now it keeps on crashing on me every time I try to play a song. Please fix it."
1155,Adds are like roaches,1,7/30/2020 5:16,I like the platform a lot but the non stop adds ever what seem to be either every 5 to 2 songs make it horrible. I’ve had SoundCloud for years but in the past few years the company has gotten so close to closing down they put so many adds and lose a lot of its listeners. Tired of basically closing the app then coming back months later to having more adds then songs I have on my playlist..
1156,Read this,2,7/29/2020 15:22,So I’ve had this app for 6 years or so and never had a problem because I never notice it but apparently this stupid app just wants to say I have 175 songs that I’ve liked when I know there’s over 700 plus songs I’ve listened to and to see that my other songs don’t show up is the reason I will be uninstalling unless I personally talk with the developers of this app
1157,Single Song Deletion From Your History,5,7/13/2020 12:23,"SoundCloud is great, but we need to be able to delete a single song from our listening history. Otherwise than that, I listen to SoundCloud a lot!"
1158,Very good music app,5,5/14/2020 9:16,I like this app a lot i have. 2 playlists full of music that i listen to on the daily. The only problem about the app that i have is ads but hey its all good because i still listen to my favorite music and i can skip lol
1159,Amazing app.,4,6/6/2020 22:00,"I think that it would be a better app if more songs were added,because sometimes the people want to listen to a certain song but,SoundCloud doesn’t have it.
But if you want to found a lot of awesome songs,I will totally recommend it.
PSDT:I love this app."
1160,"Free flowing music, that is Sound Cloud!!!",5,1/29/2020 17:00,Thank you so much for offering the gift of musical bliss for FREE!!! You give people a place to share their art forms of music and what you give us is a place to share what we love about music!!! For this I am great full!!!😄Thank You So Much Sound Cloud !!!!
1161,Good but weird design,3,4/21/2020 23:55,"I don’t understand why you guys made a completely separate app to manage stats. Soundcloud is so cool because you can use it both for being a streaming service AND a platform to share your own music. Make the apps the same way and stick to your niche. 

Also, why can’t we interact with our messages????"
1162,How can I fix this?,1,2/12/2020 4:26,The app was fine but after a while of using it the songs would cut in and out and it was very annoying since I payed for the subscription so I unsubscribed from premium and deleted the app but about two weeks later it billed me again even though I unsubscribed and I don’t even have the app anymore can someone please tell me how I can make it stop billing me for an app I don’t even use?
1163,Great game but there is one problem...,5,1/23/2020 4:02,The problem is that when I don’t listen to music all the time and I try one time it does nothing no singing no music nothing and I hate that problem it annoys me so much pls fix this SoundCloud
1164,SoundCloud,5,1/20/2020 18:32,So far one of the best music apps out their I would recommend this app for anyone who does to people that like hearing music even when your phone isn’t on a lot better then many others
1165,Such a great channel!,4,1/18/2020 22:04,"I love SoundCloud! I’ve been able to enjoy music from many of my friends. One thing I wish were different is being able to reorganize liked songs without having to form multiple playlists. Other than that, it’s great!"
1166,from Lil Kapr,5,7/20/2022 8:46,soundcloud will always be the wave its eternal and timeless i miss the old ui interface from 2020 but the concept of sounecloud as a whole is genius and it started the way for all of our favorite artists if not 70% of them 🤍🚭🧢
1167,SoundCloud randomly just broke down,2,9/2/2022 0:18,So when I download the new update everything just broke down I can’t see anything from new users everything is just not working it was barely showing anything and when I tried to look it’s just said oops it failed I don’t know how this happened can you please fix this.
1168,😀,5,7/6/2022 19:56,This app is great this app has soo much people on here that have soo much talent and more songs and that you necer thought u heard before or even from your favorite rappers they have old songs on here that are bangers
1169,love it,5,5/8/2022 0:46,I like bc they have all the songs and other can post other songs that u won’t find on other music/podcast platforms nor apps
1170,No sort of notification system,3,6/15/2022 21:22,I don’t know why they would get rid of pulse and not give you a notification tab on the app it’s that simple. Also now with the newest update you can’t even see your own reposts?? Why are they actively making this app less useful?
1171,music play,4,5/25/2022 5:14,the app is great but it needs a shuffle button on the current track so the library shuffles my music after selecting a specific song like Apple Music for example (hope that's not confusing)
1172,One issue,5,4/27/2022 6:35,"Amazing game 10/10 but  say I play a game okay, when I have an add my music stops and I have to go to the app again then play my music. Idk if it’s just me but if it isn’t please fix this bug"
1173,Tap to try again on all tracks,5,4/22/2022 13:21,"Thank you for the quick fix, I can listen to my downloaded tracks again!"
1174,Since 2011,5,3/1/2022 17:25,This is my #1 go to for a reliable app. Been using this since I was a kid and it’s just as easy as it was over 10 years ago. I thank y’all for being good to your users
1175,Login glitch,5,10/10/2021 7:40,"I don’t know if it’s a glitch or not, but I can’t get back in my account even though I have my info saved. It keeps logging me out and I’m not sure what to do"
1176,NEW BUG FOUND 2021,4,11/13/2021 16:52,There’s a bug going on right now that doesn’t let you click the profile that posted the song. It won’t even let you push more and click go to artist profile
1177,Amazing,5,6/7/2021 19:28,I downloaded this app because I saw that you could almost find every version of songs and I love this app more than any other music apps I used to use.
1178,FOLLOW VISIJ ON SC,5,2/3/2021 2:27,SoundCloud has been an amazing and greatly versatile platform throughout all these years and I continue to love and support what they do and how they are driven by most underground and more famous figures on there. 5/5 would download twice if I could
1179,Not Using It Anymore,1,2/28/2021 1:31,It’s not an internet/poor data connection issue or anything wrong with my phone but after like 8 or so minutes of listening to music the screen will freeze and you can’t push anything but the music still plays for like 10 more seconds and then I’m kicked out. It’s literally so tedious and it happens every time I’m on the app for the aforementioned time above.
1180,Less ads,5,11/28/2020 18:15,I love the app don’t get me wrong I would like less ads and to be able to download without paying for something I can get on Pandora but I like this app
1181,"Like, one problem",4,12/10/2020 21:39,"I have one problem and only one problem, the music randomly stops, only started after the most recent update 4 stars because of that, other than that, great."
1182,Love without the Hate,5,4/18/2020 1:31,"I really appreciate how creators can use this platform to release their talent. Weather it’s beautiful melodies, good mashups, or straight memes. Ads are more abundant now than before, but never been to bothersome, yet. 
10 out of 10 Would IGN again..."
1183,Slow Scrolling Through Likes,4,11/26/2020 7:31,Scroll SLOW AF scrolling throw my likes with every update...also every single time i search milidelphia by meek mill it always wanna top pull up some miley cyrus bullsh*t. other than that im obsessed with this app and will never switch
1184,This app is annoying,3,6/27/2020 1:57,"Had this problem happen to me before, but what this app does is it puts about 90% of the songs on SoundCloud, and they put it so where u have to pay for it so that u can listen to the songs (soundcloud go +) Soundcloud please fix this, cause I’m tired of this and if this happens again I’m deleting this app ."
1185,Please add a direct message feature,4,5/17/2020 3:44,Because it is the only platform that my friend has that her parents will let her have and she is NOT in a good situation right now!! Overall 10/10 app but PLEASE have a dm feature so we can get in touch with her.
1186,Amazing,5,3/30/2020 16:24,Best app out there.. gives you great music and the ability to share your own. I make my own music and I love to be able to connect with like minded people via this app.
1187,Great app,5,3/16/2020 0:58,I LOVE this app and I could even play games while I’m listening to music but there’s only one problem the ADS like one time I wanted to listen to a song while I was going to school and there was two ads but anyway I LOVE this apps it’s the best
1188,Great selection,5,3/15/2020 9:04,"It’s a great app for music lovers. 
The app update your playlist weekly base on the music you listen to. 
Always change never the same large selection. 
Keep the great work"
1189,F,5,2/6/2020 6:08,"i love the app,5 star rating,but why can’t i listen to the music i recently listened to offline like i used to?it always worked offline and now i have to have full on service for it to load,can you fix this pls"
1190,Gone downhill,2,2/20/2020 5:26,"App has gone way downhill it randomly crashes or stops playing.. lots of glitches, very laggy at times. they removed the “add to queue” feature a while back at least on iOS which is very frustrating. Think it’s time to switch to another service . I’ve been paying for SoundCloud Go for a while but recently it has not been going so well"
1191,Everything is great,4,2/12/2020 2:25,"I wish all songs were available but I get that it’s not, 5 star app in general but I put 4 because I would like a playback speed option. I wish I can just slow some fast songs and it would make it sound so good"
1192,"It’s great, but...",4,2/6/2020 21:48,"I use SoundCloud basically everyday and it’s great, but I only have one problem with the app. Some of the songs says that they are unavailable which is kind of annoying, but overall it’s a great app to listen to music to."
1193,Easily my new favorite app,5,1/9/2020 2:17,"This app seamlessly allows you to listen, upload, “like,” and just vibe to music as my mood dictates. I love the community and can spend hours easily surfing through my fav’s or discover extremely new artists just like me😘"
1194,Great app but over run with ads,4,1/21/2020 15:57,"The ads were bearable at first but not i have two thirty second ads after each song and i can no longer listen on this platform, which is unfortunate but u came to listen to music not ads."
1195,Amazing,5,6/23/2022 17:29,This app is amazing no joke but since the update I’m not able to click on the newly posted tracks nor Soundcloud weekly it would be awesome if you fixed it!
1196,Consistent stopping on songs,3,8/29/2022 22:24,A bug I’ve been having to deal with A LOT recently is playing songs and then randomly having SoundCloud stop playing the said songs. This issue is very consistent and only ceases to happen in my dreams. Please fix this bug as I am a avid user of SoundCloud
1197,FIX THE BUGS AND STOP CHANGING THE INTERFACE,1,8/23/2022 13:24,"Downloads are constantly unplayable once the song(s) are downloaded, app crashes nonstop, you have to force close the app to get it to respond, app does not transition to light or dark mode based off system settings… STOP CHANGING THE INTERFACE AND FIX THE BUGS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS!!! Really awful to pay premium for go+ yet it NEVER WORKS!!! I’ve been a SoundCloud user for years, but if things don’t change soon I’m bailing ASAP!!!"
1198,Shuffle Button Not Working,4,8/12/2022 15:58,"This is my go-to music app, however, the shuffle button is not working at all. I’ve tried closing the app as well as deleting and re-downloading. It is broken. Please fix this soon."
1199,Sort Playlists,3,7/12/2022 18:58,"It’s 2022, I should be able to sort my playlists. Either let me add songs to the top of a playlist or let me sort by recently added.

Other than that the app has made great bounds. New interface is cool and is much more performant.

Good job devs; just give me my sort functionally and its a 5!"
1200,Ads are irritating me,5,6/10/2022 18:01,"I love this app. Love the music, the fan base and everything. But I’m thinking you guys are getting a little to comfortable with the ads. It just ruins the mood for me. And no I’m not paying for plus."
1201,June 13th update: New Interface Looks Pretty [broken],3,6/13/2022 15:33,"Where are all my songs on my profile!?!? I get that they’re still on my account but I can no longer view my insights or navigate my profile. Also why I’m being promoted to purchase Go+ membership when I have PRO UNLIMITED. PLEASE FIX THIS NEW INTERFACE ASAP, AT LEAST BY THE END OF THIS WEEK🙏🏻"
1202,something went wrong,3,6/13/2022 14:52,Keeps saying oops something went wrong but I have 4 bars of data. Even when I connect to internet it still doesn’t want to work. Kind of annoying considering I paid for Go and it runs out soon. Oh and half the songs dont play.
1203,Easy to use and good quality,5,4/30/2022 4:22,I like it when I don’t have to read instructions. Everything here at SoundCloud is straightforward and user friendly.
1204,The New Look Of SoundCloud,4,6/10/2022 10:01,The new look of SoundCloud looks more of a downgrade then an upgrade could u possibly add an option that you could pick which style You would want as your for your personal version of the app
1205,Pretty good,4,5/1/2022 0:59,The app itself is really good and lots of songs but some people in the comments are advertising for inappropriate things and I don’t think that is okay but otherwise I haven’t had any other problems
1206,I love this app but…,5,12/31/2021 3:26,I love this app but all the original songs (not remixed In any way) are pro version of the app and all of Thomas the train theme songs I could find are remixes so please can you change it
1207,Fix downloaded tracks,2,4/25/2022 7:18,"Says not being able to play downloaded tracks is fixed, but it’s still broken. I just want to be able to get what I am paying for. I cannot listen to any of my music the way it is right now because all my favorite tracks are downloaded for offline viewing."
1208,Let us view song descriptions in the app,3,4/24/2022 6:49,I don’t want to launch the web version of SC just to check out the descriptions of songs when it could easily be integrated into the app. Not sure why this isn’t already a thing honestly...if Pandora can do it I don’t see why SC can’t 🤷‍♂️
1209,Quite possibly the worst application in history.,1,2/12/2022 1:15,I have updated both my app and my phone hundreds of times. Deleted and reinstalled. It is literally impossible for me to listen to a single song without the app crashing. It’s unfortunate and honestly inconceivable that in 2022 this is still an issue. I am not able to listen to the artists I want to listen to because of this issue.
1210,This app is amazing but...,4,2/2/2022 0:08,"I love sound-cloud, I’ve been using it for as long as I remember but there’s random times where I get kicked out and I currently am struggling to log into my account because of an error. Is there anyway to fix this?"
1211,This apps amazing,5,12/26/2021 6:24,Lowkey ong no cap frfr this app is amazing don’t have to keep your phone in the app to listen to music it’s easy for people like me who make music to get out there it’s just an amazing app over all love you SoundCloud<3
1212,BEST MUSIC APP,5,10/17/2021 3:15,omg! i am wordless. just download this app. it has everything and you can listen offline FOR FREE!?!? this is not a scam app for some type of fine print crap for an account. i listen to this most of the time daily
1213,Too many ads,2,12/20/2021 6:37,I had this app for 5 years at this point and it was good in the beginning but slowly they kept adding ads and I get its part of their way to make money but THERES TO MANY AT THIS POINT and yea I could just get premium but what the point of that if I can just do Apple Music a app that’s actually made for my phone so yea not worth keeping around anymore
1214,Getting worse,2,12/10/2021 16:34,"The playlist limit used to be 500 songs, but then they changed it to 499, and now its 497… can you please make the limit 500 again or get rid of the limit? And also I would use SoundCloud to listen to unreleased music, but yall keep taking the music down. Could yall also stop taking down songs plz. And LESS ADS ALSO!"
1215,Needs to be on Apple CarPlay,4,11/26/2021 1:45,"Love the app for some time now, love the randomness of songs and excited to find different mixes and mashups. What this app needs to have is be on Apple CarPlay, that’s probably what will get the 5 stars and for me to try the actual subscription."
1216,My review,5,8/1/2021 21:05,"All I have to say is wow!! This app is amazing I love it it has over 4,000 songs ,remixed and slowed songs and you can listen to songs without internet 10/10 I really recommend it ."
1217,Song,4,6/8/2021 6:53,I love this app and for the people that can’t pay their Apple Music bills this his the app for them because it’s free and great Quality I would just like if they would put lyrics with a song but for the most part it I love this app
1218,What happened,3,7/22/2021 18:25,"All of a sudden when a friend sends me a link to SoundCloud it opens in safari instead of the app like it used to. When I press “play in app” it brings me to the App Store to open the app, then when I open it the song or playlist from the link won’t open in the app STILL??"
1219,its good but i just wanna see my total plays in insights,4,6/2/2021 16:37,"i use soundcloud all the time but you guys updated it to where i cant see my total plays in my insights you guys put it to where i only got the choice of seeing how many plays i made on that day, i want to see the total plays for the last 7 days, total plays for the last 30 days, and total plays for the last year also custom range exc. i like to see how many plays i got this week in total not day by day. please fix this thank you"
1220,Great app and free!,5,3/12/2021 4:51,I love this app because it has all of my favorite music in there plus remixes and if you want a chance to become someone great such as a singer and you want to make music this app is it for you!!
1221,Great app,4,5/26/2021 11:26,"I really like SoundCloud and I’ve been using it for a while. The only thing is the comments. The comments are awful. They consist of self promos, advertising fake p**n sites, people just saying the lyrics to the song, people advertising drugs, and the occasional ok comment."
1222,Ads ads ads ads and wait for it... more ads,3,5/24/2021 15:51,The only problem with this app is the absurd amount of ads make me want to uninstall the app to be honest it’s after every song I get a ad every now and then but after every song is very frustrating
1223,Can’t download,3,5/20/2021 20:33,"It was a nice app when I had it, and I used it to listen to soundtracks that I couldn’t find elsewhere (which happened very often), but now that it requires ios 13.0 (I have an iphone 6, so I can’t update to ios 13), I can’t use it anymore. It got offloaded and wouldn’t let me redownload :P"
1224,Error,4,5/19/2021 23:28,I’ve been using this app for some time and it’s so good but recently it doesn’t let me check my music history and I’ve tried from deleting the app and reinstalling and reloading but nothing works how do I fix this?
1225,It’s,4,5/6/2021 14:29,I like sound cloud but the only thing I don’t like about it is because it seems like only the big songs by bug people you have to pay for. I like their music but can’t afford to just listen to music
1226,Decent,3,3/27/2021 1:23,It’s alright cuz i get to listen to unreleased stuff but it’s irritating cuz my playlist was letting me organize my songs to put them in a certain order and now it’s glitched or something and won’t let me move my songs. Been having this issue for a few weeks now.
1227,My rating,5,1/30/2021 22:03,Probably one of the best music apps tbh cause it has all kinds of music even like new music artist that wanna make it this is the place just get your name to big artists and people. 5 stars
1228,"Great app, crashes from time to time though",5,12/17/2020 6:20,I rarely have problems with this app. The only thing I’ll say is that it crashes out of nowhere from time to time.
1229,SoundCloud,5,10/27/2020 5:34,This app is free to listen but barley find the songs you like unlike he other you don’t have to buy the premium to listen to your songs👍👍💯💯
1230,*Soundcloud Community*,5,8/17/2020 19:39,"Soundcloud is one of my favorite platforms to upload my creations and connect with other artist.

1231,Playlist photos,5,8/12/2020 19:33,Can we be add own camera roll photos to our playlists for the mobile version?? I have a lot of cool covers I made that I want to use for my playlists but there’s no option to do so
1232,The vibe to others future artists ready to shine,5,7/14/2020 16:09,I love listening to people making their music even tho they may or may not be well known and this app is meant for teens or adults to show their talents about singing
1233,Ripoff! It will never be ad-free. Don’t pay for Go+,1,7/24/2020 12:55,"I don’t mind paying for an app to not have to listen to ads between songs. But when I pay for the app and log in, I would like it to be ad-free AS ADVERTISED. I went to the support page to find out why I’m still hearing ads in the middle of my playlists and it says that their definition of “ad-free” means they won’t interrupt the middle of a song.  Total BS!  I’m done with you SoundCloud."
1234,My SoundCloud account is bugging,5,7/11/2020 14:55,"It’s saying everything is go+ which is wrong cause my friends account it isn’t this is the 2nd time it’s done this to me. I’m an skateboarder and I film so I need the music. 
Can you guys please fix this issue."
1235,Good app,5,6/30/2020 4:23,Hi I’m Andrea and I really recommend this app bc is has all the music u want and it does not have a lot of adds and has all the songs on was looking for and this keeps me from being bored and it is really useful at a lot of times
1236,Sonic memories,5,5/24/2020 10:30,"I find SC to be an amorphous platform for 
anyone interested in producing music. 
I’ve been writing most of my life 
because I  love the process. There’s something amazing about a journey that begins and ends in the same place and SC can help anyone at any point in that journey."
1237,So good except....,4,6/26/2020 20:39,So I’ve had this app for a while and I love it... except there’s one feature. You can only repeat the same song over and not the entire playlist. That’s the reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5. If you can fix this that would be awesome thanks!😊
1238,Shutterworth 31 Healing Awesome,5,5/15/2020 9:42,"I love this app ! I am able to listen all night long biblical scriptures to help me peacefully sleep & my soul soaks in the Word of God. At the end it plays something different, so I arose & have hit it again. Is it a way I can set it up to automatically repeat."
1239,Descriptions,4,3/30/2020 22:25,"Would be nice if we could view track descriptions in this (and the mobile web browser too). They’re kind of important, especially with mixes where you have to go to your laptop/MacBook to see what the tracks are in the descriptions."
1240,Also on the wait for an update.,5,2/12/2020 1:51,Straight out the gate I loved this app. I have been using it since I received my new iPod. Now? I'm just hoping you can be able to search for your favorite artist more easily. Get it together pls!?
1241,Removed dowload,3,3/1/2020 6:33,"I like the app, but I got on the airplane today only to realize that all of my songs had been removed from downloads. This isn’t the first time it has happened either. If I’m going to pay a subscription fee to download my songs, I would kinda expect them to remain downloaded so long as I’m subscribed."
1242,Great App but a big Glitch,4,2/23/2020 2:16,"So I like SoundCloud a lot and it’s got a good variety of songs just my problem is when I go to edit my playlist, once I hit done it switches back to what it was before which is quite annoying especially since I always add new songs:/"
1243,Love it!,5,5/25/2022 22:33,Can listen to music while doing other stuff and making playlists! Highly recommended for friends etc.
1244,It’s good but the new update messed it up.,3,8/25/2022 3:11,"I like this app, until the new update came. As soon as I went in and all of my liked songs were deleted!! I was mad, and whenever I try to like a song it doesn’t let me! Like what the heck?! So now u have to find all the songs again."
1245,Disappointing Recently,3,8/24/2022 21:29,"These recent updates have been so disappointing, I cant search a song and click it without a prompt for SoundCloud Go, I can’t use Siri to play a song because it just wont search. Please get rid of this, SoundCloud was so much better & simpler then."
1246,UPDATED VERSION IS GARBAGE,2,6/17/2022 20:30,Whatever you guys did in this update messed up the whole system laggy not wanting to play songs like I didn’t have these problems on the old version but y’all forced me to update now look it’s broken can’t even listen to music half the time cause I don’t wanna deal with the app y’all got some work on you’re hands 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
1247,Issues since last update,2,6/16/2022 10:54,"Love SoundCloud and it’s my go to music streaming platform but ever since the last update, it’s been buggier than usual. The app crashes frequently and I have trouble loading things at times when I know I have internet. Need these bugs fixed so I can enjoy this app again"
1248,New update is awful,2,6/13/2022 15:09,Ever since I got the new update I haven’t been able to play music it always says that there’s a loading error or that something has gone wrong my Wi-Fi is fine and so is my cellular connection this only started happening after the update. I don’t know what’s going on but you need to fix it.
1249,"Love it, but I have a request",5,5/11/2022 5:44,"I only use SoundCloud, and I’ve always wanted to be able to shuffle through all my liked songs to listen to"
1250,Best music app,5,12/13/2021 3:46,I love how you can skip whenever you want and can play your playlist in a certain order and uploading music is very simple and easy
1251,Glitched and deleted my account.,1,4/19/2022 13:30,"I was just listening to some music earlier today, when suddenly the app glitched and it kicked me out. I closed out the app and re-opened, it tried to login and apparently it deleted my account. I tried both of my emails and my Apple ID and every time I tried to login it said that there was no account. I’m not sure what happened but I am definitely not pleased."
1252,Playlist search bar,2,2/14/2022 14:52,Why when I go into my playlist of 500 songs can I not have a search bar at the top so I can find the song instantly instead of searching it through the main search I shouldn’t have to scroll all the way to the bottom if I just wanna hear that one song u feel me
1253,Artist profile,5,11/22/2021 9:05,Love this app to death !!! But as of this month I haven’t been able to click artist page from the song ! Please fix this minor inconvenience
1254,Plethora amount of song choices,5,9/26/2021 21:38,It's the greatest and is a million times better with the remixes of the songs!!! A1 download this and you won't be disappointed.
1255,Yes,5,7/7/2021 23:43,Other then the adds and certain songs not being able to be listened to id recommend
1256,My review on SoundCloud,5,6/14/2021 2:47,I can find all the songs I want to listen to and I don’t have to pay for it which I really love so I rate this a five star rating I vary much recommend it to others
1257,You know what’s good 🤌,5,5/18/2021 21:56,I love SoundCloud. Make it more interactive between users. Allow full conversations in song and album comments sections. Give us emoji reactions in commenting. Implement virtual “party” or “hangout” rooms between users and creators 🙏
1258,10/10 app,5,2/24/2021 16:24,"I can listen to any remix that isn’t on any of the other music apps I listen to! Since anyone can upload songs, it’s easy to listen to songs."
1259,Really chill app for different music!!,5,1/30/2021 16:44,One of the best music streaming so far on the internet to discover new and different types of artists from all over! Highly recommend 👏😇
1260,Great Music App!,5,12/5/2020 21:25,I love that I can find most songs on here. There isn't a lot of adds and plus they are only 30 sec each. The most adds I have gotten was 2. Highly Recommened
1261,Amazing minus one bug,4,1/2/2021 10:55,"SoundCloud is really one of the best music apps out there. The app however needs work. Will not stop crashing in the middle of a mix/song and then it loses what you’re listening to. Very irritating, please fix"
1262,star aponte,4,12/12/2020 18:02,"App is great, but as for me, sometimes it glitches out as a part of it saying that i don’t have wifi to use it. Or it will stop playing the song, even though it says you can listen offline."
1263,Souncloud,5,11/9/2020 21:53,I think personally its one of the if not the best app for listening to music. Even without Go+ theres still not many adds and they have so much variety.
1264,"Love it, but I really want to talk with friends.",4,11/21/2020 0:50,"I love SoundCloud, but I would (and I know tons more people would) love it if you added a way to communicate with others in the mobile SoundCloud app and website. Overall besides that, the app is amazing."
1265,Great app,5,11/3/2020 22:39,I got this app two months ago and it’s great very little adds a lot of music choices and you can make all type playlists you want overall it’s a great app
1266,This is the best!,5,9/26/2020 16:05,"So..First I’m gonna say your gonna be on this app 24/7 because I’m on it every minute of the day
And when I’m in front of my mom I just go upstairs and play roblox and listen to music it’s the best!"
1267,"just needs a lil help with the casting option, i know its new but my google is a bit slow",5,7/29/2020 23:35,This new update won’t even play my music bro it was fantastic until it stopped working correctly
1268,Used to be good,3,8/2/2020 14:46,"This app used to be so much better, their used to be little to no ads, the comment section wasn’t a whole self promotion convention and it wasn’t as buggy. My main issue is the ads. The same Verizon ad plays every other song. I have Verizon, leave me alone pleass"
1269,SoundCloud,5,7/22/2020 3:38,This is way better than what I had. There is very little ads. You can listen to any song any time. Would 100% recommend to a friend.
1270,Seems legit!,5,6/1/2020 0:27,"Well-organized, efficient like and comment system, able to play while using other apps. Haven’t been here long, but I’ll drop a more detailed review when I’ve gotten familiar with Soundcloud."
1271,Shuffle button,4,7/1/2020 8:10,"Can you guys please add a shuffle button when you are in a song instead of a shuffle button for the whole playlist, because sometime I want to play a specific song and then to shuffle after"
1272,Soundcloud,5,5/14/2020 19:37,There is every song you can think about and one bad thing about it is you can’t heard it when there is no connection and also too many ads no cap.
1273,Artist > Platform,3,5/29/2020 18:04,I love the app because of the smaller artist I follow but the app keeps making it harder and harder to not delete and get rid of SoundCloud go. Every couple of updates the app gets stuck loading. First time I can open it in 2 days and I can only listen to one song before it crashes. Please fix.
1274,App crash,5,5/2/2020 13:56,For my phone the app keeps crashing for no apparent reason at all. I still use it but it keeps crashing. In the next update can you fix the crash issue.
1275,app not letting me log in period,1,4/16/2020 1:45,I’m sorry to say but this app is performing very badly in my opinion because it won’t let me sign into my account so therefore I can’t listen to my music at all and you guys say that you’ve “fixed” the bugs and you “constantly update” the app well you guys need to fix this stuff now because I myself make music and post my tracks on SoundCloud so if you guys can’t fix this you’ll be having a lawsuit on your hands..
1276,Amazing for studying,5,3/4/2020 19:24,The fact that you can listen to music based on your moods is amazing!i just go in the study category and I have lots of options to choose from which is absolutely insane!great job honestly.
1277,"Very easy to navigate and use, but not all songs are on here.",4,3/21/2020 8:56,"I really like SoundCloud for how easy it is to navigate, use, and how some songs are on here instead of other platforms. However, some songs on other platforms won’t be here."
1278,My favorite music app!,5,2/1/2020 18:22,I love this app because you can find people with the potential of being big and you can post you own music to or just listen to others music. 10/10
1279,Bug,5,8/4/2022 16:13,"There is a bug when I click a song, it starts playing the second one"
1280,Question,5,7/7/2022 19:26,"Great app and i'm a fan of it, but i keep getting notifications about a user, ""fortrappersonly"" telling me to ""dive back in"" despite me never listening to any of their music. Hiw doni stop these notifs in particular?"
1281,Used to be great but now way too many ads,1,7/30/2022 19:50,I used to love this app and there used to not be very many ads but now there’s two ads between every other song. That’s way too many! I get that artists have to be paid but really? The ads that come up are so annoying as well. I just want to listen to my music in peace without having to pay for the ad-free experience.
1282,SoundCloud,5,5/7/2022 14:36,Is one of the best music apps it has every music and it has helped me find some of my new favorite songs you should definitely download this app
1283,SoundCloud helped me keep works that would of been stolen,4,7/2/2022 18:16,"I appreciate SoundCloud because it is something that lets you reflect, expose, study, analyze, collaborate, discover, give thanks, show appreciation, support, uplift, download, and invent in so many more words... thank you"
1284,SoundCloud rocks,5,3/11/2022 12:04,I like SoundCloud...easy to use and upload music. Song protection and a map to show you where you are playing and which tracks are the hottest.
1285,Love ir but it hangs when playing a song,3,4/2/2022 0:27,"Hello, i’m on the latest version of iOS and the app hangs whenever i play a song. happens around 60% of the times. i have to close the app and reopen it to continue listening. this issue has been happening for a while now"
1286,SoundCloud,5,2/14/2022 15:58,"Love it so far! Best place to find authentic music, artists & upload your own music creations to get discovered by the people that can take you to the next Level. Let’s Go!!!"
1287,Here is the place to hear music from every genre,5,12/21/2021 17:57,"I enjoy finding the gems of music that are passed by by commercial music streaming services, radio and so forth.  

Thank you!"
1288,Soundcloud review,5,11/18/2021 21:35,I love this app because they have all my songs plus unreleased songs from my fav artists i just wish there was less ads but overall its great !!!
1289,Can’t listen to listening history,5,8/9/2021 23:51,When I try click listening history it doesn’t work
1290,"The app is great, but..",5,7/18/2021 5:23,"This is a great free app. There’s only one problem. The comments. There are sex ads and comments on it. Please fix that, there are kids on this app. Everything else apart from the comments is good."
1291,Very good,4,7/25/2021 14:58,Every feature of SoundCloud is excellent and very user friendly. The one thing you CANNOT do in this app is DIRECTLY MESSAGE PEOPLE BACK on a mobile device! Other than that SoundCloud is a phenomenal app and I would highly recommend it to everyone.
1292,New User to App,5,6/24/2021 22:21,"I discovered this app after seeing one of my favorite artist post their new release to sound cloud. So far no complaints, love that I can find music from most any genre."
1293,Please add messages to SoundCloud mobile,4,6/28/2021 21:44,"Hey I wanted to let you guys know that your app is amazing and I love it, I would choose this music app over any other music app, but… I would like to see messages to be brought over to mobile SoundCloud."
1294,Ashlynn,5,4/16/2021 11:25,I think this app is great for if you are trying to listen to something quick you just click your recent music you listened too.!
1295,App is extremely laggy,2,5/24/2021 10:11,"The app is extremely laggy. Id start to scroll through my music, but as i scroll, it lags so much to where i sometimes play another song by accident just because the app lags so much. It takes forever to scroll down the music as well because of all the lag i get. Please fix this."
1296,Was good for a while,1,5/9/2021 15:54,"I used SoundCloud for almost a year and the day I bought SoundCloud go anytime my screen is off it crashes 10 seconds in the song, if I keep my screen on it won’t crash, I’ve tried reporting the problem but they don’t seem to wanna fix it or get back to me. I’m moving on to another app we’re developers actually respond and know how to make a working app"
1297,To many adds,3,4/19/2021 1:42,Soundcloud is good it’s just when I get out of the app and swipe up on it and take my AirPods out the music plays out loud and there are to many adds every two or three songs there is one or two adds that pop up other than that it is a good app
1298,SoundCloud next gen availability,5,4/4/2021 1:29,"I love SoundCloud for giving an even unbiased platform and your algorithm for song selections is what I love above all the other music streaming apps, thanks for your continued service"
1299,Sound cloud review,5,3/28/2021 1:01,This is a great app it has all my favorite artists and songs I highly recommend this over any other music streaming platform
1300,Sound Cloud saved my life.,5,3/20/2021 11:04,Sound Cloud gives artists the opportunity to share their music with each other.
1301,Amazing ✨,5,3/19/2021 3:43,"It’s amazing, at least in my opinion. Not much adds, all of my slowed songs, and I love the comment feature where you can comment on just a certain part. Love it ❤️"
1302,Amazing,5,2/20/2021 0:41,SoundCloud is amazing you can listen to music make music and download do what you want with your account but not to inappropriate and not necessary for this app I am happy to give this app 5 stars
1303,Good music app,4,3/13/2021 18:27,It’s a good music app the ads are the only thing also it doesn’t have all the songs on here but majority of the songs are on here and you can make your own play list all you have to do is heart it
1304,It’s good,4,3/4/2021 2:32,I would like to change the playlist names and change the picture of the playlist instead of having the first song cover.
1305,Actually the best no cap👍🏾😄,5,11/18/2020 13:34,Btw there barely adds you can listen offline anywhere at any time that’s amazing no need to pay for free adds and while your phone and on consoles and pc it’s the best
1306,Signing in,5,10/28/2020 11:02,For some reason I keep getting kicked out my app and then when I get back on it logs me off and when I try to sign back in it doesn’t let me in
1307,Great app,5,10/26/2020 23:24,This app is super convenient and easy to use. Definitely not like other apps where you have to pay a lot of money in order to use which is cool.
1308,SoundCloud,5,10/25/2020 22:50,I recited sound cloud because you don’t need to be searching for songs every 3 minutes you could just make a playlist
1309,amazing great,5,9/17/2020 7:27,i use this and i make my music on here but your copyright thing aint working bc i make something that sounds like a close thing but it aint. my Name is 434taken. Now yall should really let me edit more
1310,App review,5,8/11/2020 18:14,The app is great but I was listening to my playlist and 30 minutes later all my playlists is go+ plz take go plus off I don't have the money to pay for music that why I use SoundCloud.
1311,Ads,5,6/30/2020 17:59,"Not everyone smokes and vapes🤦🏽‍♂️, and if im in the app and swipe out after an ads start why does it pause, that is a very unlike able feature about soundcloud that im sure many demand change"
1312,Fix this!!!!,4,7/17/2020 20:40,"Soundcloud is a great app, I don’t mind the ads at all, and the audio quality is usually great. But I’ve recently had an issue whenever I search for songs and play them, the app crashes. Please fix this, it’s annoying and tedious to deal with."
1313,Upcoming new artists,5,6/7/2020 11:35,"I love hearing fresh new sounds, from up coming artists...  these artists work very hard and use their $$ for Studio time while many holding down jobs, and families thank you sound cloud"
1314,Money thirsty,1,6/19/2020 13:40,They just updated it last night and made it to where only abt 100 songs are ok to use if you don’t have premium I had a playlist with all the music I liked on it with about 300 songs and they were all turned off because I don’t have premium I can’t listen to anything on this app anymore and they need to realize that music is for everyone and not just people willing to pay for it
1315,Playlist Problems,4,3/11/2020 13:10,SoundCloud is great but there is one major problem. There are issues with adding a song to your playlists. When I tried to add songs to my playlists they will pop up and disappear and say I great new playlist.
1316,😐,4,2/28/2020 15:22,"I love this app and using this since 6th grade, but for some reason one of my accounts (it was like User and then bunch of numbers) got either logged out or accidentally deleted, and I definitely don’t want to find the 400 music that i liked, any way to fix it?"
1317,Bruh,4,2/9/2020 6:41,Love the app I’ve used it for a while now but all of a sudden half of the songs on my playlist were turned into previews which meant I had to pay to listen to the song that I’ve been listening to for a long time this is stupid
1318,Too many ads,4,1/7/2020 13:17,This app is great for music but after a couple years of using this app it seems like they just add more and more ads. Literally after every song or two you have to deal with an ad now and its very annoying.
1319,Good but too many ads,3,1/28/2020 15:27,"I like SoundCloud I really do, but it has too many ads to the point I’d consider switching to another application/ means of listening to music. It really irritates me that they do not space out the adds more plus on top of that they hit you with two 30 second ads that you cannot skip."
1320,Better than SoundCloud.,5,6/21/2022 0:14,Simply better than SoundCloud in basically ever way. Especially unreleased or underground artists less popular songs.
1321,Rating review,3,9/2/2022 1:13,Its been good till it starts randomly deleting all my liked tracks that i had saved when SoundCloud first came out and when i go click on an artist none of the artists music pops up. My internet good its been updated like what is going on SoundCloud?.
1322,Likes not appearing in Notifications tab,3,8/28/2022 20:28,"lately i have been unable to see who has liked my tracks, my phone will get the notification that someone has. however, when i go into the app itself it only shows reposts and comments:p plsss fix this yall<3 luv uuuu"
1323,Following,5,6/16/2022 16:54,Good app but with the new update it won’t allow me to see the most recent music the artists I follow post. It just keeps loading and loading.
1324,LINK SHARE STOPPED WORKING,5,4/27/2022 19:48,Great app was previously rated a 5 star - The link system stopped working this is effecting my promotion - It sends link to down load app not to view my music THROUGH app Or Google please fix soon
1325,Good but…,4,6/15/2022 9:01,With the new update it doesn’t identify what song you’re currently listening to when editing playlists which makes it more challenging to edit playlists. Please fix this.
1326,Great way to share your music,5,3/24/2022 11:10,SoundCloud offers a great platform for musicians to shorten and share their original music.  Free for basic uploading and sharing for roughly 50 or so songs.
1327,Bangin,5,2/14/2022 20:47,This service is the ONLY place I can find so much of the music I am addicted to.  SoundCloud and I have known each other since 2012!  Every time I open the app it’s smooth as silk!
1328,Amazing!,5,1/14/2022 19:55,I’m glad I don’t need to pay money to play songs and I’m fine with ads so if you are fine with ads and love music like me this app would be perfect for you!
1329,Rate,5,7/12/2021 17:02,Great app overall for posting music and listening to all categories. Great app for just browsing on shuffle and listening to up coming and underground artist for any category.
1330,Why SoundCloud,3,12/5/2021 10:52,Pls give me back my account let me post again I don’t have this kind of money you are ruining my dream like why are you doing this just because I posted to many songs I was just trying to make my album and you ruined it I couldn’t make a song
1331,Quality is low,2,9/27/2021 18:55,"Sounds fine on a speaker,  but put on sennheiser headphones and there’s so much detail missing.   where did you put the missing data?  Did you just delete what the artist did or do you put all the missing info into other songs.  Genuinely interested in where 1000+kbs could disappear to."
1332,Sharing playlists,4,8/28/2021 16:15,"My cousin tried to share his playlist with me but when I click on it, it takes me to the site and says listen in app so I click on it. But it brings me too the App Store. So I’m not sure how to get his playlist."
1333,Issues with airplay,4,7/17/2021 13:25,"I love this app, Great music but I’m having issues with connecting my speakers through airplay.
Please fix this problem.
I called Apple and they said it wasn’t a problem with my phone, It is an issue with third-party app"
1334,good app but liked tracks glitch is annoying,4,4/20/2021 16:09,good app but there’s annoying glitch where if i try to unlike a song that has been deleted from soundcloud from my liked tracks it gets removed then it gets added back to my liked tracks. whenever i put my liked tracks on shuffle play and it goes to the deleted song it doesn’t skip by itself i have to turn on my phone and skip it which doing it often is very annoying
1335,Cant use app,1,4/22/2021 3:19,"I’ve been trying to use SoundCloud for over a year. I got a new iPhone and when everything transferred over the app stopped working. I  had a previous account but I was willing to start over. I’ve shut my phone off, cleared the app, deleted the app, used wifi, changed wifi, used cell signal.... every combination every couple weeks I remember. Nothing works."
1336,Xbox,5,2/20/2021 20:28,I can’t connect my SoundCloud to my Xbox all it’s says is loading failed can you please reply to this and fix this bug all of my updates are up to date.
1337,Lags,4,3/12/2021 6:08,Keeps freezing. Will press the selection tab on a song and won’t pop up for like 30 seconds. Will try to favorite a song lags for like 30 seconds same with reposting.
1338,Great App But...,5,1/3/2021 5:28,"It a great app, great interface, and it’s just an overall good service/company. I have one suggestion though. Could y’all please make this app compatible or available with Apple Watch."
1339,Enhancement request,4,1/12/2021 16:18,"The best app of it’s own kind that I’ve been using for years now, I believe so it’s the time when you should introduce Spatial Audio for better audio experience for the customers. It will be much appreciated ♥️."
1340,Please help,5,12/30/2020 12:13,"I’ve been using soundcloud on English but it changed language on German. If I go on website - it sets english. If I use it on my phone - it sets on German again. 

Upd. I resolved my problem. Really good app"
1341,Helping The Industry💯,5,10/17/2020 6:04,"SoundCloud is one of the last platforms standing thats putting out Independent Talent out to their audience on the internet. Keep SoundCloud up and going, the recording industry needs this platform💯"
1342,Fix your app!!,2,10/24/2020 15:06,I use this app DAILY and have for years.. how come it’s become so glitchy and crashy?! Especially lately! It’s annoying af! And the excessive amount of adds make me wanna stop using this app. The ONLY reason I keep it is cus of the exclusive remixes you can’t find on other streaming services. But I might delete it if the bugs don’t get fixed.
1343,Jazz station,5,6/13/2020 11:07,"I am a big fan of jazz instrumental music;I turn it every morning in my store and the customers loves it, SoundCloud doesn’t interrupt you every minute like other online music streaming apps! They worth 5 stars!"
1344,I have a suggestion,4,9/24/2020 11:05,you guys should make it to where we can add the same song multiple times to one playlist and then be able to put that playlist on loop
1345,Subscription,4,8/22/2020 16:58,"This app is great and I’ve been using it for about 2 or 3 years, but I recently bought the $6 subscription and I still don’t have my go+ even though I paid the 5.99. So i’m a bit confused on that...I really hope my money wasn’t taken."
1346,Dark mode IOS 13,4,8/17/2020 9:06,I love  SoundCloud Mobile been using it for years now when it comes to dark mode in the search box when I type you can’t even see what you are typing it’s a small bug but it could be fixed
1347,Good App but ..,5,5/30/2020 23:28,Sometimes it's laggy and when I wanna scroll down it takes forever to scroll and it just freezes but hopefully you could fix that but it's a good app overall 🔥
1348,Idk why it took me so long to fw SoundCloud,5,3/2/2020 10:40,"Way better than almost any other music app I’ve had before, the commercials aren’t the worse, obviously wish they were less but 🤷🏾‍♂️ I fw sound cloud heavy now"
1349,What the heck happened?,2,5/6/2020 19:42,"This app crashes every single time I start playing a podcast. Even if I pause it, and go back a few minutes later and hit play, it’ll crash. It typically works when I reload it but my god it’s annoying.

I have no idea what you did in the last update, but it clearly broke what used to be a perfectly functional app."
1350,It’s great but I have a problem,4,5/2/2020 2:20,"This is a great app so far. But there is a problem that bothers me. When you like a music, it is flickering on and off. Like orange and back to white. This needs to be fixed. It’s annoying when it does that. Can you fix it plz?"
1351,Glitchy,4,3/29/2020 2:35,Idk what’s going on with these new updates but notifications are coming super late and I have SoundCloud Go and when I download my playlists somehow they keep removing it from my downloads so I have download all the music back every time I get on the app
1352,Delete Comments,2,3/12/2020 18:49,"I think there’s a lot of people like me that wanna hear music alone, people commenting in other peoples music is not good, they not giving feedback, they are “self-promoting” cause they think that is promoting, so can y’all please update SoundCloud so the app can run without the comment section, it will be very appreciated cause it disturbs for real...

Hope this problem can be resolved very soon"
1353,Have been a huge SoundCloud fan for years.,5,2/21/2020 12:42,"I absolutely love this app. However, the last three days I can’t save any tracks to my library. I click on the heart, it’ll be orange for a second and then it unsaves. Please help me"
1354,the de facto new music discovery outlet,5,1/30/2020 0:44,"Always pull up Soundcloud to hear new tracks from upcoming artists. Lot’s of potential stars on here and daily listens to great songs, bars, and racks that I can’t get enough of, and I hope they make it big."
1355,Freezing problems,3,2/10/2020 19:09,I love SoundCloud and have been using it for years but since last year I’ve been having major freezing problems. I update it every time there’s a new update but still the same thing it just freezes all the time. Anyone else have this problem?
1356,Random crashes,4,7/17/2022 6:32,"UI continues to improve over the years, but more than occasionally the app just quits, especially if it’s in the background or you’re using AirPlay. Pretty annoying."
1357,gotta pay to use the search bar????,3,8/26/2022 1:46,"L after L bro, i've had quite a few bad experiences with soundcloud, the worst two being my account wrongfully taken down and now having to pay to use the search bar...this app is going further downhill smh"
1358,Worst UI in Existence,2,8/15/2022 18:17,I don’t understand how difficult it can be to make a working UI that doesn’t break every other month but clearly soundcloud does because that seems to be there intention every update. Okay you can fix shuffling playlists but fix searching songs or do we have to pay for it😭
1359,pay for everything,1,8/12/2022 22:47,"you have to pay for every little thing, whether it’s a certain song, album or to even shuffle play a playlist you have to PAY to do any of those simple things, let alone the Pro plan which is the most expensive doesn’t come with any of that and is separate from the soundcloud go subscription"
1360,Sick new look,5,6/13/2022 8:12,Opened my SoundCloud app only to realize it’s a new new setup. It’s looks so clean and has a new feel to it. Makes me feel modernized since I’ve had this app since like 2015
1361,Great access,5,10/12/2021 18:43,"This app has access to a variety of music, even full old school hosemusic mixes!Very accessible and even helps promote your own music that you create!"
1362,I don’t know what’s going on,3,6/10/2022 23:12,My account was logged out of and every time I log back in it says there’s an error I’ve been with you guys for years and forgot which email I use for this app but I guess after a few days of not using it it logs you out? I’m so unhappy
1363,Soundcloud,4,6/8/2022 16:08,"I love using this, in fact I post most of my music on here. It’s extremely easy to upload and for others to listen to. I can share my music to my friends, family, and fans with ease."
1364,Real issues,1,5/21/2022 16:41,"-Followers list isn’t alphabetized or searchable
-Connecting to Bluetooth speakers never works, songs won’t play
-There are like 5 different entry points to promote the paid service Souncloud Go which take up valuable room for other CTAs, buttons like searching your own library, making playlists, uploading music, playing albums, discovering new artists, and more.

Please fix!"
1365,Just a bug fix,4,4/12/2022 12:02,"SoundCloud is great but for some reason the slightest sound made on another app pauses it, isn’t the point to listen to it on other apps? I don’t want to keep unpausing it can you please fix this issue?"
1366,Phoric’s Rate,3,10/18/2021 2:58,Overall really good app but only problem is that it has way too many advertisements. Not to mention that the ads be like 30+ seconds long and it doesn’t let you skip the ads…. The advertisements be in different languages too smh.
1367,I love this app,5,7/30/2021 4:31,Every single music I search for is already there for me would really recommend all tho the price is a bit hight sitting at 12$ for premium
1368,Podcasts,4,8/9/2021 22:39,"I love the app, only thing is, I wish that podcasts didn’t start from the beginning when you go back to them. They should start from where we left off"
1369,Read review,5,6/21/2021 21:24,"This app is amazing if u don’t like music. If u watch tv JUST for the commercials, THIS IS YOUR APP. If u want TWO separate 60 second adds after EVERY song, look no further !! This app is for you"
1370,Easy to use. Alternative to big tech.,5,4/25/2021 15:13,"Besides a lot of my regular mainstream content, I also get content on SoundCloud that can’t be found anywhere else. Love it."
1371,Yearly prescription,4,5/23/2021 12:56,"Great app and would buy Premium Go+ , however, I did not see an annual option.  Most entertainment apps offer both monthly and a annually @ a reduced rate.  Hope you all will consider this in the very new future."
1372,Everything good but adds,4,5/3/2021 10:16,I have had SoundCloud for a while but now every song comes with a ad it really annoying  but you can really find what ever sound you have been looking for so yeah
1373,Amazing!,5,4/5/2021 5:30,"You can do things with this app that you can’t do with others, the power at your finger tips with this app is amazing!  Thank you for having an Amazing platform."
1374,Deleted song bug,3,4/21/2021 0:37,"Songs that were either deleted or just won’t play won’t remove off my liked songs when I unlock them. They just relive themselves and put them
At the top of my liked songs please fix this"
1375,Must have,5,4/3/2021 17:20,"Love this app there is infinite number of music. Ways to make playlists of you favorite artists, albums, and even some underground music  it’s all most endless."
1376,best music app ever,5,3/12/2021 1:48,i remember when it was 2016 and being able to hear new and upcoming artists without having to pay is the greatest musical experiences I’ve ever had
1377,Great Platform for discovering smaller artists,4,2/24/2021 16:26,Smaller artists who do pretty good music themselves. Wouldve rated higher if the ui and finding music wasnt so confusing and counter intuitive since more popular songs are always recommended at the top.
1378,Like being assaulted with ads?  This app’s for you.,1,12/31/2020 6:55,"Title says it all.  You can’t listen to even two songs in a row anymore without having a big unskippable ad in between, destroying whatever vibe was created.  And guess who gets the money for the ads?  Not the artists of course.  SoundCloud is dead and trying to play the same game other companies are now: shamelessly selling your data."
1379,The app is okay but the moderators are in something,1,12/28/2020 9:19,"I really liked listening to my 2 YEARS worth of saved music, when I found out that my account got perm banned without a warning via email or other. I was listening to a song that the mods keep taking down shortly before, but for real? That’s like arresting a hostage in a bank robbery because they “were technically a participant in the robbery”"
1380,Different,5,10/21/2020 9:34,I pay for a bunch of music platforms but SoundCloud give me the opportunity to always hear something different
1381,Loved SoundCloud until,2,12/15/2020 2:22,I've been listening and purchasing stuff off of the SoundCloud app for years but now they have made a update that only requires ios13 or greater and my phone only has 12.5 and doesn't have any more updates I am still on the iPhone6plus why is this happening SoundCloud fix this update
1382,"Works alright, need to get more experience though!",4,10/29/2020 3:55,I just started using SoundCloud and so don’t have much experience with it. Seems to have an okay interface.  I have see how well their recommendation algorithm works!
1383,Love the app but.....,5,4/29/2020 20:12,"I love this app!!! I can find all the music I want to hear but the app might have a bug because from time to time it would close out the app. 

Hopefully the next update they fix the bug."
1384,Good platform but too many Ads,2,9/14/2020 23:41,The amount of ads they play has gotten out of hand. If you’re looking for a free platform for music avoid this one if you hate obnoxious ads. Also they play 2 different 30 seconds ads back to back every like 3 songs it’s unbelievable who making these decisions at corporate.
1385,It’s great but then there’s this,4,8/12/2020 5:11,"I love the app, there’s almost no ads and the quality is great but this 1 month thing completely ruins it, it makes most of your songs 30 second previews which require SoundCloud go + to listen to completely"
1386,What the heck soundcloud,2,6/15/2020 4:51,okay so i’ve been a lot time soundcloud user and have preferred soundcloud for a long time. this weekend i went to my cabin where i didn’t have any service and i came back and about 90% of my songs were soundcloud go only which is really frustrating. i know soundcloud go isnt super expensive but it’s honestly just disappointing.
1387,Closing itself,5,4/8/2020 5:53,I’m writing this because I’m abit frustrated. I love SoundCloud but I’ve had a problem. The app keeps closing out and doesn’t play my music. I’d appreciate that you can fix this problem. Thank you!
1388,Downloads would come off,4,3/20/2020 5:47,"After I renewed my SoundCloud go subscription, I downloaded my songs again and as soon as I disconnected from wifi, all songs erased and I had to download them again. Tried this several times"
1389,Trash developers,1,3/1/2020 0:36,So SoundCloud froze. I couldn’t exit the app. I couldn’t make calls. I couldn’t text. I couldn’t even make emergency service calls. I couldn’t force restart my phone. Wasted an entire day waiting for the phone to run out of battery so I could restart the phone.  Horrible experience and absolutely caused by some crap overpaid SoundCloud developer. Somehow SoundCloud developers managed to brick my phone. Trash developers for a garbage app.
1390,Bad,1,1/10/2020 16:21,I have been on this app for years and never had a problem. Until today I go to play some music and every song on all my playlist was on SoundCloud Go+. They never did that the day before. I understand that some song are on Go+ but changing it after over a year or a couple months is just irritating. To be honest I wouldn’t wanna be on this app for long. I thought I really loved it but now it’s just pure irritation.
1391,Pretty great but having trouble,5,9/2/2022 0:53,"There is a glitch that took out the music i like out of my playlist, there used to be 59 tracks but now its just 30"
1392,Tho is so good,5,5/1/2022 7:23,This is really good app for those of are looking for music without any hard work just play any thing and it will do the rest of the work for you
1393,Why?,3,8/23/2022 3:14,"So why do we need a pro subscription to properly use the search bar now? That's a basic function that a music app should have without paying 13 dollars a month. I already have a subscription, just not that one..."
1394,it's like an above ground pool...,2,6/24/2022 0:38,"it's a pool! but you want more. Bugs and glitches. can't switch to my other SoundCloud, it just signs in the same profile over and over uhhm I somehow logged in with my info and was in someone else's account. Recently the Google sign in is down and I can't post songs from my phone anymore. no beuno senior"
1395,Clearing my listening history,3,6/17/2022 22:07,"Soundcloud, for a music app, is pretty good. But the recent update seemingly took away the “clear listening history.” I like to keep it empty but now i cant clear it. Hope they bring that feature back. Good app otherwise"
1396,New update won’t let me play any songs,1,6/13/2022 17:13,I’ve went on all of my playlist and every single time it says loading error when I try and play a song that i’ve had on there before the update. If i spam it sometimes it will work but i’ve had this app for close to 5 years and never once had this problem until the new update.
1397,UI,4,6/12/2022 22:57,amazing except for the new UI it's so ugly and has so many problems. plus for people who have had soundcloud for a while it's gonna take forever to get used to the new things. i hate it please fix it.
1398,FYre,5,4/23/2022 19:59,This is the first place I’ve been able to find Dj‘s from the past that I grew up with… from hombre and salvation in Miami to the tunnel and sound factory in New York…. To the new talent of today….this isn’t your mom's iTunes !!!!
1399,Versatile App,5,1/5/2022 17:17,"Soundcloud may not appear that diverse, but as you start getting into all the various producers that make new & old music unique it becomes a treasure to your favorite playlists."
1400,Please fix some issues,3,2/2/2022 15:47,"I been getting more and more ads recently. But that’s alright, I understand its free for me i don’t pay for premium. But im having a issue where I can’t delete old playlist. Like i can but if i reload the app there back again everytime."
1401,new update is bad,3,12/17/2021 0:18,"i’m sorry BUT THIS NEW UPDATE ISNT IT!! i’m so confused i miss the old clean small icon soundcloud and the color scheme and one blink AND ITS ALL GONE! and when i try to play something it pauses or gets really quiet randomly

at this point i don’t know if this a glitch or an update or both please help or change it back"
1402,Honestly pretty good,5,11/20/2021 22:45,I would say this is a very good app for listening to music. But I wish if you a mobile device you could restart playlist.
1403,I mean it’s free music,5,10/29/2021 13:11,Like bro enough said naw I’m playing it ain’t all good it’s like buying off brand soda some are good that you haven’t heard of but the stuff you had just doesn’t seem right
1404,CrossFade/Gapless playback,4,11/12/2021 13:15,"Please add a crossfade option, I’m listening to lady gaga’s chromatica album, and some of the song are supposed to mix seamlessly together but the pausing in between that is annoying. I hope I can get a response, it’s still a good app tho 👍."
1405,Very useful,5,1/14/2021 2:12,I like how you can play your music and it doesn't stop while on other apps or stuff except ones with sound bit that's ok😂
1406,"Good app, but needs a few things.",3,2/19/2021 1:40,I wish that SoundCloud made it possible to listen to music on one account through different devices. Especially for SoundCloud Go users who pay every month to listen to music on this platform.
1407,Ads,5,1/4/2021 20:21,Who’s dumb idea was it to put two 30 second ads back to back after every song
1408,Great way to start your music career,5,12/20/2020 12:07,Simply just create an account . Start uploading your content. You get what you pay for so free is limited. With that being said. Good luck.
1409,Slowly becoming bad,3,12/20/2020 21:01,I love soundcloud and have been using it for years however the ads have slowly started becoming more frequent. I understand that their needed but every two songs i receive an ad and it’s getting annoying
1410,The best,5,12/11/2020 4:04,I’ve been using this app for 2 years now and I don’t doubt it at all I love this I have lists of my favorite songs on here who ever made this song your amazing
1411,I ❤️this app!!!!,5,12/9/2020 21:14,I love it I can play my favorite music turn my phone off and it still plays AMAZING I can also play games how freaking amazing is this app!! I say 5 stars everyone should get this app!!
1412,Please don’t make it require IOS 13.0 and above,5,12/4/2020 15:09,I use SoundCloud a lot and I have tried to update it to the latest version and it won’t update. Please fix it.
1413,Great Music,5,11/13/2020 1:38,"Has Every song You could ask for, Able to go out of App is a big one for me, I’d Download the App But be careful Because there’s the Filter I learned for my Friends"
1414,Annoying bug,3,11/22/2020 16:06,I have an issue where users deleted or removed songs and i cannot get them out of my playlist and every time you delete them they reappear at the top of the likes playlist and don’t work pls fix
1415,Lola,5,11/7/2020 19:47,"Love that I can store all of my funky download frequencies, instrumentals and meditation. These things are all in one place. Ease of use at night when I want help with sleep and during the day for pain relief."
1416,Improving slowly,5,10/12/2020 17:30,It’s getting to be hi resolution tool...slowly but I want it to be able tell me which friends are sending messages and who liked my tracks. Otherwise its awesome.
1417,I’m having some problems,4,7/18/2020 17:56,"This app is my favorite to listen to music but there is a problem, when I try to listen to music it plays for a second but then stops and doesn’t work again"
1418,Full tracks,3,8/2/2020 17:47,"SoundCloud was my favorite music app until you guys recently made it to where you have to buy SoundCloud go+ just to listen to full tracks. It doesn’t make sense, nobody is gonna want to go from listening to free tracks whenever they want to paying for music every month."
1419,Glitches,4,6/11/2020 17:48,"I have over 1,000 songs on likes so that might be a reason for why my app closes whenever. It also unlikes songs that I just liked then shuts down. Plz fix and I will give 5 stars 😂"
1420,Kinda stupid,2,6/28/2020 20:54,"I was getting ready to listen to music on soundcloud till I found out all my artists I listen to made it premium songs, and obviously not all of them did that, soundclound probably did that to make more money, which is completely stupid, now no one can listen to their favorite songs without having to buy the premium 🙄"
1421,Notifications,3,5/29/2020 4:09,All of my notifications are turned on for the app but I stopped getting them a few weeks ago. Is there any way you can fix that? They’re turned on and all that but I’m just not getting them when an artist posts a new track or anything.
1422,😐,3,3/20/2020 20:14,"Look I loved this app key word loved
Just one day I got on and a bunch of songs where premium only which only left some of the not so good songs so if you get premium you are fine but if not you can listen to most of the current big artists songs or one of my personal favorite artists juice WRLD (rip to you)"
1423,Listening Limit,3,3/10/2020 3:25,this app was the best app to listen to music for me and now i get a listening limit on my music and now 90% of all music on my playlist are 30 second previews. Im ver disappointed since i've been using this app for over a year and this has never happened until now. 3 stars for now.
1424,Just why,3,2/22/2020 17:33,"I love sound cloud and used it for a while now, but recently, all the music has to be paid for. You were able to listen to YOUR favorite songs without no worries and now you have to pay for all of it basically. The app is unusable unless you are willing to pay for it"
1425,Soundcloud,4,2/14/2020 6:47,Soundcloud is the second most used app in my phone. I am ALWAYS listening to music and soundcloud is the app i do it on. I really like how i can listen to all my favorite music while my phone is locked. Would definitely recommend soundcloud to a friend!
1426,Great😘,4,2/6/2020 0:16,I think this app is great because you can listen to music without Wi-Fi and I like how you can make a playlist of the songs you like and the creators also added a feature where you can add comments on the songs I like that.
1427,App malfunction,4,2/3/2020 1:23,every time I go into the music I’ve listened to from later on and try to play music it freezes and goes off the app then I have to delete the app because it repeats itself over again than I’ll have to reinstall it.
1428,Why can’t I play my playlist,5,8/11/2022 19:38,"It’s been a great app by far , but why can’t I play my own play list now ? I have too subscribe to play my own playlist I made ? Boutta delete it no cap"
1429,Amazing Streaming!,5,8/2/2022 21:46,This app is very good when it comes to uploading snd streaming music! I have been uploading my creations and so far its been going amazing! Definitely recommend it.
1430,Great,5,5/19/2022 21:14,Such a great app you can choice any song you like for free they have ads every 70min love it so much keep doing what your doing you have a new fan sound cloud
1431,Issues,1,8/2/2022 21:16,"This app has been full of issues the entirety of the past 4 years but recently it had gotten to the point where I can no longer tolerate it. I cannot even get through 1 song without the app crashing, have tried reinstalling it, messing with settings, updating my entire phone and it has still not fixed the issue."
1432,Frustrating to use now,2,7/30/2022 2:15,I have been using SoundCloud for well over ten years now and it used to be great. The ads come in after every or every other track. I get they need to make money and I don’t want to pay for another subscription but it really is a bummer how pervasive the ads are now.
1433,Ads,3,6/22/2022 3:54,The new update gives out way too many ads like every three songs I get an ad like before had a lot but not this much your just doing this so we subscribe to the premium but everything else is good
1434,My playlist is gone!,2,6/13/2022 14:32,"I have been using SoundCloud for as long as I can remember, and when I just recently opened the app, all the music that I have saved is gone and the playlist, and I can’t now use Dark mode for appearance on it, I am not sure what has happened and I would like it to have it back to how it was."
1435,Its amazing its just that..,4,6/10/2022 22:17,Every time i play music and try to make an edit or sleep it randomly turns off. This hasn’t happened before the update and i don’t know why it’s happening.
1436,Help,4,6/2/2022 4:40,I’ve been using this app for 3  years now it’s pretty good but I kinda have a complaint idk why but when I try to heart one of the songs it doesn’t let me and if it does it I hearts if someone knows how to fix it please help me
1437,Great music app!,5,4/21/2022 3:33,Every song and artist is on here. They do a good job with keeping it up to date and relevant. Also good to discover new artists and songs you haven’t heard of!
1438,"Good, but not perfect",4,5/12/2022 7:14,"SoundCloud is a wondering platform, not only for listening to music, but spreading your love for certain artists/genres
It has many issues, but it is still the superior music platform"
1439,Rate,5,12/21/2021 3:05,I love SoundCloud it has every song and different versions of the songs to ! Only thing I dislike is the ads every here and there
1440,Advertisement bombardment,3,12/22/2021 13:25,I’ve been using soundcloud for years and it’s been great but recently i’ve been getting raped by their adds. It’s like every 5 songs i get 2 30second adds. I feel like it got something to do with joe biden having no idea what he is doing with our economy
1441,Good option.,5,6/3/2021 23:56,Good option. There are many paid streaming platforms all of theme cost the same. This is another to consider
1442,Advertisement system is broken,2,11/14/2021 6:47,"Sometimes when I’m done with an advertisement because I can’t afford SoundCloud go, the app freezes and makes me reload it only for me to half to watch another 1 minute ad. There are also many other glitches but that is the one that is most common."
1443,They deleted all of my liked tracks!,1,9/21/2021 0:45,"I have been a faithful SoundCloud users for many many years. I made many playlists on the app and I have liked over 2,000 songs. Now all of my favorite songs from years back and my many playlist are deleted. I am devastated because of this. Do not download the app. Find another music app because this is unacceptable."
1444,Horrible music app,1,8/6/2021 0:59,"Horrible app, gets worse update after update. Not only does the app get worse but there is more and more ads after each update. I’m gonna be honest, there’s probably not a single app that will give you more ads. Do yourself a favor and don’t install this, get any of the other thousand apps for music, trust me it will work better than sound cloud"
1445,Too many ads,3,8/5/2021 13:44,There are just way too many ads now. I understand they need the money and want you to buy the premium or whatever but this is making me recreate the same playlists on other platforms.
1446,Bugs,3,6/11/2021 19:54,My review for SoundCloud is a 3 only because it has been acting weird for me now . When I hit the pause button it should go from the triangle to the play button but it just stays at the triangle butting . Also it’s really slow I updated it already⏯
1447,An artist platform,5,5/15/2021 3:19,This really gives artist a chance to actually show off their artwork and I respect because I did find some good songs on here.
1448,Amazing!!! <3,5,5/7/2021 20:56,"The app is amazing, the ad’s are just a bit to long when you are on a laptop and you can’t even skip them. Overall I love the app and the community!! :D"
1449,Love this app😫🤌✨,5,4/17/2021 22:48,I love SoundCloud it has amazing artist and you can have your phone off while listening and you can loop your songs and it’s just an amazing app thank you!😁✌️✨
1450,Doesn’t bring all of the website’s features,4,4/18/2021 11:03,"This app is good, but the website has way more features.
- having a separate page for every song
- seeing who liked a song
- a notification tab
- direct messaging 
-seeing the buy link
But the most important and annoying thing is you can’t see a music’s description inside the app. It is the worst because sometimes a description can really help you understand the song."
1451,Sound Cloud,5,4/16/2021 17:01,Been using this since it’s inception. Great platform for artist to showcase their music plus you get to hear new music from some of your favorite artists.
1452,Awesome app,5,3/15/2021 8:20,I have just started with it but so far very easy to maneuver and easy to build your Playlist.  Love the way it looks  and a huge selection of music
1453,Listening history,4,3/22/2021 15:11,"hey. I really enjoy using the app but I have a problem for few last months that I can't access to my listening history completely...
plz take care of it. thans❤️"
1454,I need help,5,10/5/2020 0:23,"So I forgot my SoundCloud login 
so I need to email for my SoundCloud 
can you find away that you can get my account back I send a link but I need y’all’s email can y’all do that ? For me"
1455,This app use to be amazing,3,2/27/2021 9:17,So because I own a IPhone 6 with no IOS 13 I cant listen to music anymore thats kinda lame in my opinion because not everybody wants to switch phones and/or buy a new one so please make it towards where people with IOS 12.5.1 can use it as well
1456,Issues??,4,2/24/2021 20:12,"I loved SoundCloud, the app is AMAZING and helps starting artists but after the new update I can’t even open the app because it keeps crashing every time I attempt to open it. Besides this its a great application"
1457,Good except for one stupid thing,4,2/1/2021 6:44,Alright. I’ve been using this app for about a year now and have experienced no problems what so ever until now. The app keeps crashing no matter what I do. It’s extremely stupid
1458,Only problem is the playlists,3,11/4/2020 14:45,The app is good and all for a music player but the worst part is the playlist delete themselves from time to time and if your account gets banned EVERYTHING is gone so be careful about what you comment and upload
1459,Great music app,5,9/5/2020 23:25,"Absolutely love this free app, where else I could easily listen to all the awesome creations and updates by my lovely daughter - dhc, after she decided to quit her high paying senior developer’s job two years ago, to pursue her dream of a ... uhm ... starving musician?  🤣"
1460,Suggestion For Mobile,5,8/19/2020 21:03,"So it’s a good app 5/5 stars, but I have a problem. It’s not possible for you to loop a playlist on mobile. Just saying, you should probably add the feature to loop playlists on mobile."
1461,Buggy,3,8/25/2020 15:58,At first this app was alright but then when I started realizing that this app just freezes by itself it gets extremely frustrating and sometimes it just makes me want to delete the app but it is a really good app I just Believe that it can be really really buggy sometimes
1462,Accessibility issue,4,8/24/2020 9:53,"Yes the app is great. Only one thing! I as a visually disadvantaged, using iphone with voiceover accessibility mode, I face some difficulties  with the app, like some buttons are unspoken/unlabelled espicially in home tab voiceover doesn’t read what’s there. I urge you to fix this in upcomings updates with my sincere thanks."
1463,Why,5,6/10/2020 22:50,"Why are 95% songs in my playlist is now Go+ bruh, before nothing was Go+ and now I can listen to nothing but songs that should be Go+  but aren’t. Everything is is cool."
1464,Pretty good app I recommend,4,7/18/2020 2:55,"Minus the constant reused vaping ads if you don’t have premium lol, and a glitch that kicks you sometimes to where you have to re-download the app, it’s a good app. Really fun and you can find almost anything on here minus occasional premium only songs."
1465,SoundCloud,5,6/2/2020 0:03,It’s the best music app the only problem I have with it is when songs get blocked in country for copyright reasons but that doesn’t even happen that often.
1466,Very gud,5,5/3/2020 5:46,"The only problem I have is that SoundCloud crashes when I open it, press on a song, or after an ad is finished gets a little annoying."
1467,Get it!!!,5,1/26/2020 17:09,"You know Apple Music, well that costs money this is free! All the songs you want for free just search it up and heart it and you can listen to it when ever you want! 

     Thanks again SoundCloud"
1468,What in the name of the lord,1,4/1/2020 9:56,"Advertisements, advertisements when you click on your first song. Advertisements when you shuffle a song. Advertisements after every song. Advertisements are everywhere, there’s too many of them. And not even a variety either it’s the same 3 ads. And sit down and relax because you’ll hear all three of them multiple times in 30 minutes"
1469,Very Disappointed,1,3/24/2020 1:29,I am addicted to listening to lil peep but soundcloud made almost all of the songs soundcloud go+. This is very sad but listening to Peeps music kept me calm and relaxed because I suffer from panic attacks very often. Soundcloud please change peeps music to free to listen so I can listen to lil peeps music again. I know it’s hard to think about the people like me but please change this back his music helps very much not just 30 seconded previews.
1470,Xbox?,5,7/6/2022 16:51,I use this app bc I’m an underground artist listener but is there anyway this app can be updated and be able to control music from the phone but on the Xbox app like Spotifys feature
1471,It’s Bussin’,4,8/25/2022 21:51,It’s great. Low key if you don’t pay then you’ll get ads. At least you can stream most songs and enjoy listening for free. I like that I can lock my phone with the music still playing.
1472,Shuffle??,4,8/12/2022 1:53,I’ve been listening to Soundcloud for 7 years and this is the first time I’ve use soundcloud without shuffling in my playlist and it hurts. Please switch it back for the old Soundcloud. That’s just bad :(
1473,This is a great app!,5,6/12/2022 19:03,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for a bit more than a year, and I can tell you it’s a really good and simple app to use. This app needs more attention."
1474,Glitching,4,6/22/2022 15:27,"Every time I try and play music it plays for about 15-20 seconds, and then closes the app, other than that the app is amazing and runs perfect again except for the first bit"
1475,It’s okay,4,6/13/2022 16:15,It’s been a good app for the last 3 years of using it but after my app got updated none of my music would play and I deleted and reinstalled it and now all of my playlists are gone.
1476,Finally,5,6/10/2022 13:07,SoundCloud has been my primary music all forever and this update they just released finally caught it up aesthetically and I’m really happy with it. Thank you guys
1477,SoundCloud,5,6/6/2022 2:20,Really great app for songs would definitely recommend to someone who needs a somewhere to listen to music
1478,Button,5,5/24/2022 10:56,Can you bring back the clear listening history button? Thanks a lot!!
1479,SoundCloud Review,5,4/10/2022 22:38,"I love this Music app, I can play on my favorite songs.I love the no ad experience with this app. I didn’t pay anything for no ads it was all included with the app."
1480,More Songs,3,5/16/2022 16:19,I think there should be songs that are the right songs that seem right to the original songs. All the songs that aren’t original fill space and waste space for playlists and I don’t like that.
1481,Best music app,5,3/19/2022 15:48,It was one of the best things I’ve ever downloaded for music. The best part is That it’s for free when you have a account. I have a tik Tok playlist that I could play all day
1482,You should download it,5,2/11/2022 12:18,I can’t because I can listen to my music on my phone  with it off I can listen to it while I’m doing things so amazing
1483,Posting,4,3/11/2022 13:53,"This app is amazing! I love all the Music you can find, But I'm having an Issue that I know Is not my Wifi. I am a Music poster on your App, and Anytime I post it will say Something went wrong? You think you can Look into it? Thanks :)! Great App!"
1484,Problems,5,11/17/2021 16:13,SoundCloud won’t let me upload some songs and it’s lagging a lot it shows I have 3 likes but one person viewed it
1485,Very Good,4,12/18/2021 12:19,"I love the interface and how people can comment, but you should filter comments.
If I was making a song then thought “oh man, I wish you could make music IN the app.
BandLab is a competitor, SoundCloud. So add new stuff, give things a whirl."
1486,Fix the bug,4,12/12/2021 23:31,"Y’all need to fix the bug where I go into another app, the music just stops and takes off or just freezes please fix it as soon as possible thank yu"
1487,Navigation,4,11/21/2021 21:57,"Decent update, I just have a problem navigating from songs to artist profiles. I have to search up the artists themselves instead of tapping on their names to get to their pages."
1488,👍🏻,5,8/10/2021 4:02,"It’s a great app! The ads are evenly spaced out so you’re not getting 5 ads every two songs, and you can listen to almost any song you want!"
1489,One of my top apps,4,10/20/2021 18:29,my review is a 4/5 i love this app so much the reason it’s not a 5/5 is cus of the ads sometimes they are 1 minutes long or more other than that i would definitely recommend
1490,Not working,1,10/19/2021 7:04,I love SoundCloud and have been using it for years. Recently it won’t let me play any song it just shows me the error sign every time I click on a song. Only a few songs I can play but only for the first 5 seconds and then it says error everytime. It’s been happening for about 3 weeks now I just want to listen to my music :(
1491,Astounding,5,8/8/2021 16:20,I have used SoundCloud for years and it has never let me down. Plus it plays with a locked phone. 10/10
1492,Update,5,6/29/2021 22:59,Honestly soundcloud is an amazing app but it really needs an update for when someone is playing music for a long time on ALL platforms
1493,Great but...,4,8/6/2021 21:59,Horrible subscription prices. Paying them for add free listening to others works for the app is kind of dumb when you get add free by using safari. So 4/5 because there is an inexpensive way around ads. Nice try guys
1494,Really nice app,5,4/16/2021 15:27,I love this app you can hear many music that isnt in other music apps and u can upload your own  music without having to pay
1495,Too Woke,1,6/29/2021 15:43,"Apparently you guys don’t like free speech if it doesn’t fit your racist liberal woke narrative. Don’t like the fact NGO actually told the truth so you ban him, you’re basically communist sympathizers and the problem with this country. Keep your communist beliefs but you won’t profit off me. (Didn’t even give a reason for the ban, did you think “we’re communists and this is what communists do” was a little too truthful?)"
1496,Tee,5,3/25/2021 11:23,My Problem With SoundCloud Is That I Can’t Change My Playlist From Private To Public Anymore Like I Once Did EveryTime When I Do It Show’s Something Is Wrong I Need U Guy’s Fix This Major Issue ASAP
1497,Great,5,2/3/2021 16:46,Just wish that some songs you weren’t forced to get SoundCloud plus to listen to but other than that 10/10
1498,Amazing,5,1/22/2021 22:08,I love this app because it’s free and I can clean and listen to music without worrying about my phone turning off and the music stops. 10/10 recommend ❤️
1499,Amazing!,5,1/10/2021 15:28,Has all the songs I search for and many more versions of it as well. A ton of songs to check out as well ❤️❤️
1500,Soundcloud,4,1/6/2021 21:45,I am having a problem with soundcloud it’s not letting my like certain songs & not saving them either can you plz fix this problem
1501,Please fix the force quit issue,4,12/26/2020 17:00,"I love SoundCloud. I’ve used it for years. Recently my app keeps closing out completely and I lose my place in the track I’m on. 

This is a 5 star app, hopefully the issue gets resolved"
1502,Doesn’t work,4,12/15/2020 2:36,"It’s really good because ya know,,,a weeb needs I listen to their Yagami yato patreon audios But everytime it has the cloud thingy and I download it again but it always doesn’t download

10/10 would recommend but please fix this 😺"
1503,Used to be good,3,12/12/2020 17:20,"If you don’t mind adds spammed at you after every two songs then it’s a great app. Way overboard with advertisements, they should go back to the old version when you could actually listen to music and stand all the spam."
1504,Best Recommended Music!!!,5,10/30/2020 17:26,No other app has this good of an algorithm for recommending music! I look forward to “The Upload” (the automated playlist it creates based on your history) everyday.
1505,It’s good but too many ads,2,12/10/2020 16:40,I used to love SoundCloud but over time there is too many ads. They used to be good about it but now it’s an ad almost every other song which is extremely annoying. They do have all the good remix’s of songs that Apple Music doesn’t have!! But they’ve added too many ads!!
1506,Randomly stops playing,1,12/8/2020 1:33,"This latest update would randomly stop playing the current track and forgets (rewinds) where in the track it was playing.

The bug also causes the Music widget to forget about the app, so I have to unlock the phone, open the app and press play in the app.

No recent updates in iOS. Only update is the app, 4 days ago."
1507,Best app,5,10/22/2020 22:01,This is the best app I’ve ever had it has everything that you would want in it and all ur favorite songs I recommend this to anyone who loves music!
1508,Update please,5,10/9/2020 4:21,"Me and my freind use this often but it need an update it skips my song and it also is changeingvsome lfvthe pictures of my freinds songs, but outherwise it is great"
1509,THANK YOU,5,7/17/2020 21:47,"I have been looking for an app like. This is the best because, the sound quality is awesome and all the best artists are on here. I am totally satisfied. I was tired of using pandora, and it sucking all my iPhones data."
1510,Sound cloud,4,9/17/2020 2:32,"The greatest app to listen to music, but zero star in ads. Why I need to listen to ads in the middle of listening to something else? 
Why I need to pay to not listen to ads? Why it is the opposite?"
1511,Randomly turns every song into Go+,3,8/5/2020 6:19,I click on the app and sometime songs that didn’t have Go+ now have it. And no the artist didn’t make them Go+ because I make a new account every time and they’re normal. Please fix that bug it’s really really annoying thank you
1512,Unbearable amount of adds.,1,7/21/2020 13:32,"It’s ridiculous, they have an unbearable amount of adds. You will open the app and be greeted by an add that you can’t skip. Yes I get it- pay for premium. However I already pay for other premium music apps that are worth it. Nonetheless it’s annoying every time I want to listen to a song that isn’t main stream and I’m bombarded with ads. For listen to a couple of songs."
1513,What a delicious way to listen to music,5,7/13/2020 20:50,"There a few things toy can do over and over that increase from repetitiveness. 
Music is one of them and thanks to SoundCloud I’ve got access to a universe of music."
1514,Ads are starting to pop up more,3,7/15/2020 18:33,"Ik I’m able to buy plus but rn I don’t have enough money since I lost my job from the pandemic and when I try to listen to music two 30 second ads pop up after every 2 songs, and it use to be one ad every 10 songs."
1515,About SoundCloud,5,4/7/2020 13:56,Soundcloud is a app where I feel like when I am listening to music there is someone trying to get you through something. This app is amazing. Keep it up
1516,Uninstalled/Re-install,3,6/12/2020 1:35,"As of June 11th, 2020 I was forced to uninstall the app. No reason why the app wouldn’t open for me WiFi OR NOT. I’ve been a soundcloudGo+ member for years and having to re-download over 2.5k songs is TOO TIME CONSUMING FOR ME. Fix your bugged out app! Or update to an “instant restore” after something like the app unwillingly not opening happens."
1517,Soundcloud,5,3/11/2020 1:09,One of my favorite music apps. It always has the exact song I want to hear. Would highly recommend it to every single person.
1518,Great app 💯🔥,3,3/21/2020 18:11,SoundCloud is the best app especially for artists that are looking for inspiration or just get new styles but sometimes I can’t like the songs I want to like and that’s getting annoying 😤 if you can please fix this as soon as possible I’d appreciate it and I’ll change my review once it’s fixed 🙏
1519,Love this app,5,1/18/2020 1:08,Yo I recommend you get this app everything is free and you have all the songs in the word hip hop singing everything it’s like you hit a jackpot we’re you can listen to all the songs
1520,Sound cloud,5,1/13/2020 10:12,I like the only problem is that when your site says free trial and you open it and it says you have to use a credit card to try it that’s not free
1521,It’s been helpful with an old audio collection not easily available,5,9/7/2022 2:34,I’ve been able to use French in Action with this! So thankful!
1522,Shuffle issues,4,8/12/2022 13:27,"After the most recent update,I'm no longer able to shuffle my playlist ...you're only able to shuffle liked songs. That's lame ."
1523,I normally don’t do reviews,5,7/18/2022 15:39,The update is great. I love the new look it’s so organized and slick looking now. I really like this new look on SoundCloud I might even pay for the no ads now lol
1524,SoundCloud,5,5/21/2022 17:55,I love this App it’s easy to use and it has up and coming Artists? As well as the Artists we love that are accomplished and we get to hear all there new music ‼️
1525,It’s been great till the last update..,2,6/26/2022 17:12,"I’ve used SoundCloud since 2014 and have never had a problem with the app, till this last update.. Legit every time I get a good 30 seconds into a song, the app crashes. EVERY TIME. And I’ve already uninstalled and reinstalled the app a number of times with no difference."
1526,Review,3,6/13/2022 15:59,It’s a good app but the newest update is a bit glitchy and visually unappealing. Glitches such as liked songs disappearing from playlist are pretty common on this new version and it’s a hassle to rearrange songs within a playlist .  Other than that it’s a great app
1527,The new version of the is awful,1,6/8/2022 15:30,The previous version with the multiply panels in the stream option was super easy for scrolling music. Scrolling through one at a time is time consuming. The previous version was far superior. Will be looking elsewhere to listen to music. Let me know if you ever go back. Some things are better left untouched.
1528,Always good sound,5,5/3/2022 17:52,"Plenty of good content.
I repeat listen to industry leaders content and believe it has taken my success to whole new levels."
1529,Best music app,5,5/3/2022 13:43,"This app gives you unlimited music unlike any other music app, it gives you leaked music, and it gives you a weekly playlist W app"
1530,SoundCloud,5,5/1/2022 4:18,It’s a good app :) use it on and offline. All songs in different version. But the songs are there under payment as well.
1531,Great!,5,4/17/2022 0:26,"I use it to listen to music while I do homework or while I sleep. I also use it to upload my own songs, and it’s great for that! 5/5 service!"
1532,Unable to create an account on the app,1,4/29/2022 17:25,"I’ve tried countless times to create an account on the SoundCloud app but each time it either says, “something went wrong. Try again later.”, or, “We couldn’t sign you up. Our bots think this account looks too much like spam.” I don’t know what else I can do at this point… is it something bugging with the system?"
1533,Very disappointing,1,4/23/2022 14:36,"After 5 mins I deleted the app. Why? Because despite selecting the genres of music that I like, the app did nothing but suggest genres that I hate (such as rap). There’s no way to let the app know that I don’t want these suggestions. There’s too many other music streaming apps that will allow me to get the music suggestions that I do want. Good luck with this very flawed app."
1534,SoundCloud<3,5,3/15/2022 1:01,SoundCloud is a great app you can turn your phone off and your music will continue to play it has a lot of great qualities I definitely recommend<3
1535,So good!,5,2/11/2022 20:38,"I love SoundCloud! You can find almost any song, and even edit audios! It even has slowed and reverbs. Say goodbye to endless searching and hello to endless fun! There aren’t a lot of ads either."
1536,Underrated since day uno,5,2/1/2022 4:25,Honestly been listening since middle school and I don’t find a reason not too I always find my favorite underground music here 👍🏼
1537,Love ❤️❤️,5,1/29/2022 14:03,I absolutely love being able to support smaller artist while they are doing what they love. One of my friends is thriving off this app and getting the attention he deserves.
1538,Actually nice,5,11/13/2021 19:57,You can find anything on this app as long as your willing to look for a little while. Being a free app that’s a given tho👍
1539,Everything I need is on SoundCloud,5,7/1/2021 20:26,"Car playlist…Beach playlist…Vacation playlist…Unwind playlist…Wine&Champagne playlist…Shake It playlist…Can’t Fall Asleep playlist…WakeUp and Face It playlist…
My SoundCloud is always on."
1540,Amazing,4,10/12/2021 4:39,Does exactly whats needed and there’s minimal ads in comparison. Desktop version is far superior because there is practically zero ads. Only complaint is that desktop doesn’t have dark mode and that there isn’t an EQ (I WANT MORE BASST-T)
1541,Car Play,4,8/28/2021 23:45,Would be better with compatibility with CarPlay! I’m always listening to sound cloud in the car and this would make it a lot easier!
1542,The ADS,1,8/10/2021 5:13,"I’ve always loved using SoundCloud but when your trying to listen to a song or a pick a new one and you hit a ad, it automatically pauses the ad if you close the app which is extremely frustrating when driving. Im fine with ads but please make it so you don’t have to WATCH 30 second ads with your phone on the screen"
1543,Sound,5,6/6/2021 20:29,I like it because if you like a song like it and you can listen to it every day without WiFi that’s why I like it
1544,My opinion,3,6/13/2021 7:02,I like the app but the adds appear way to many times and are very long with out being able to skip them also some songs that are like goodies but oldies are all unavailable due to not having premium 😕
1545,THE BEST!,5,5/26/2021 20:38,The best app out there. I love all the unique beats and artist. It’s so smooth abroad too. It’s the only app I can get into without draining my battery and going offline too. It’s been so amazing to have music in South America.
1546,Ruined by Commercials,1,5/30/2021 19:08,I can live without SoundCloud. Life was just fine without it. It was nice to hear the community-submitted music but now it’s just one big advertisement unless you pay over $100 per year for their premium service. I know this is “normal” now but it doesn’t have to be. Let me know if you ever change the advertising model to something better
1547,CarPlay version,5,5/5/2021 20:35,"Still waiting for CarPlay version, for how long the fans must waiting too see the app on car screens ? We’ve loyalty to sound cloud, so give us a toast 😉"
1548,Disappointing,1,5/8/2021 18:29,"This app should not be lagging here and there, especially on one of the latest iPhones out there which is the iPhone 11. Its really frustrating to see it lag the way it does here and there and then smoothen out after scrolling a little more. I never have a lag problem with any other app on my device. Please fix this issue."
1549,I did not know about it,5,3/29/2021 16:45,"I did not know about the app and now that I do I just love it! Has most of the songs that other apps just blocked cause of territory differences.

Love it"
1550,Best music upload,5,1/14/2021 20:29,Thanks for this awesome platform music with this help I could get viral and have fans to love my projects and collaboration with other Artist thanks again Team SoundCloud.
1551,Glitching.,4,3/5/2021 12:28,"I love the app but I’m constantly glitching out. It won’t load songs even if I have 3-4 bars of wifi, skips to the next sing after a few seconds and crashes to name a few."
1552,Features,4,2/13/2021 13:10,I think being able to view more in-depth stats on the app would be awesome ! And viewing the description of the track also
1553,Amazing,5,1/9/2021 20:35,Even if you don’t find the songs you aren’t looking for but there’s amazing songs and I didn’t even know they where here
1554,I love this app because,5,10/21/2020 0:07,"I can play this while I’m playing other games, needs improvement by a recommended section"
1555,MY FAV— but sometimes Laggy and unorganized,4,1/7/2021 17:11,"I love soundcloud, but a new app design is needed and a better way to categorize artists, i have like 3,000 songs saved and it’s messy. It’s also slow and lags, scrolling time takes so long."
1556,It was ok,3,12/8/2020 20:28,It was great using it but I can’t use it anymore since it needs the iOS 13 update which I find a bit annoying but it was ok but some of the adds were a bit long and it lagged when u tried to scroll down on ur list
1557,Need app on AppleWatch,5,9/5/2020 14:49,"Love this app, but would love an Apple Watch version so I could listen during a run so I don’t have to drag my phone with me.  Would consider a subscription but not having an Apple Watch app is a dealbreaker."
1558,Cigarette/Vaping ads,4,10/9/2020 16:15,"I like soundcloud n all but whenever I get an ad most of them are about cigs and vaping, its just very annoying when im just trying to listen to my music and I keep getting swarmed by these kinds of ads😑"
1559,Soundcloud is so underrated,5,9/4/2020 2:39,Soundcloud is seriously the best music listening app. The playlist that it creates for me each week are always spot on. I love the variety of music that you can find on the app. It’s my go to!
1560,"All of sudden all my playlist, I have to pay for",2,8/17/2020 18:44,"All of a sudden I have to pay for my playlist that has been free for the longest. No way, if this is a bug.. it needs to be fixed because I updated my app and it’s still saying all my songs are sound cloud on the go. This doesn’t make any sense, this isn’t the first time this has happened."
1561,Please help me,1,7/31/2020 2:45,"Music helps me though everything and recently I’ve been going through a lot and I’ve been using music to help. But today I went on sound cloud and all of my playing where gone, all except 1, I had so many playlist and songs for different things and they are all gone except for 1 played I don’t use that has 13 songs, please help me get my stuff back, I need my playlist back."
1562,Crashing/ bad update,1,7/17/2020 5:46,"This app was rocksolid until the update yesterday, now it crashes constantly. Not worth wrecking the basic app just so you could add Insights, which were already covered in the Pulse app. Big fail. Really, really, really tired of apps making updates that add some negligible benefit while breaking basic functionality. Please stop. (Will gladly pull this review if fixed.)"
1563,Sound clouds decent,5,6/22/2020 21:59,Ay dawg there’s a lot of stigma about SoundCloud and like people think that if U have it ur a bad rapper but the music u find on it you can’t find anywhere else so it’s great definitely would recommend
1564,It’s extremely good,5,5/31/2020 15:10,I just posted my rap and it got over 50 views in the first day. It has 80 views right now. It’s good when your starting music. And it’s also good because you can listen to music.
1565,Sounds Go( whyyyyy ),1,6/9/2020 22:29,At first I really like SoundcloudBecause it was free to useAnd help me withConcentrating and listening to whatever I wantBut since they added GoI can’t even listen to free musicBecause he only gave me half of itWhy should you pay for the whole song Like I gave you guys are trying to make money but youShouldn’t only gave us half of the songLike it’s fine with ad free or better audioBut what if people can’t pay for thatEach month paying five or seven dollars
1566,Great!,5,4/25/2020 18:42,"I would highly recommend it. It’s free, easy to use , and your able to make your own personal playlist. Try it out!"
1567,Amazing,5,4/19/2020 12:16,This app lets me listen to any of the songs I want and it doesn’t include any adds!! Most apps I have to pay in order to listen to music
1568,Link blocked on social media,5,4/3/2020 4:18,I love this app I upload my music here all the time I’m a up and coming rapper and my link for my account is blocked to share my music from Facebook Instagram and Snapchat please help
1569,Ideas,5,2/16/2020 2:04,"I think you guys should add the lyrics in the app. The reason why I said that because some people want to learn the lyrics of the songs, so if SoundCloud have the lyrics, people can look at it"
1570,You can barely listen anymore !,1,3/19/2020 15:13,"I have used SoundCloud for a while and everything has been fine, but recently there has been an update that changed that. Almost every song that I listen to has been turned into a Go+ track. Now I can’t even listen to music without getting annoyed because all of my songs are just previews of the full track."
1571,Why Is every song on Go,4,3/14/2020 15:24,"I’ve been listening on SoundCloud for about two months and I was going to listen on my playlist and all my songs are on Go, and all my other playlists. Please explain what is happening."
1572,Malfunction,5,1/31/2020 3:41,Every time I go to my playlist and click “ edit tracks “ it always takes me right back to my home screen. Can you fix this please
1573,If ur bored read this to laugh,5,8/17/2022 12:58,I’m in the bathroom and I am listening to music with no headphones (also SoundCloud is rly good but please I want to upload an audio from my PHOTO LIBRARY not the resent files)
1574,My entire liked list gone,3,9/3/2022 17:52,"Upon opening this app after updating it. It deleted all my favorites, and when I try to search them up. They’ll show for a few seconds then disappear immediately."
1575,It’s deleting my playlists,2,9/2/2022 0:10,"Only reason why it’s a two star it’s because I haven’t had a problem since I joined and haven’t got an ad in weeks. But just 5 secs ago my playlist went from 225 songs (which I had) to 20, to nun. And it deleted my whole other playlist. Fix this or I’m deleting."
1576,The music worlds my life !!,5,1/14/2022 12:18,"I’m DJ Quiksilver on the edm worlds the runs and the beats hold it all togeagher as with SoundCloud you all have that 1 extra some that takes the music to a whole other level …….

1577,Fix your app,2,6/23/2022 21:13,"I got banned using my main email (for some god forsaken reason after using this app for more than 4+ years). Trying to remake an account, the app is stuck whenever typing in your age and gender which is really annoying. There’s stuff on here that you don’t find anywhere else."
1578,Can’t even sign in or make new account,2,5/5/2022 5:38,This is the second time I’ve run into this problem. I downloaded it like 2-4 months ago and had the same problem it says server error and that wouldn’t be a problem if later it worked. Someone should fix this.
1579,Can’t access my full listening history,3,4/3/2022 22:47,This app is great and all but starting earlier today I wasn’t able to access my full listening history even when I was pressing the button for it.
1580,Nothing is ply,4,2/28/2022 10:27,I tried switching off my wifi and turned it back on. Still it didn’t work. Then I restarted my phone and same. Nothing is playing. Kindly fix it please
1581,Always a staple,5,11/18/2021 17:31,Always make sure I keep an updated version of the app. So much underground/hard to find music on this platform
1582,Soundcloud.,4,12/19/2021 19:44,"I love it! it lets you exit while listening to music, awesome! and i love how many songs are on there, however. You have to pay for some songs? Don’t like that but overall pretty good!!!!. :)"
1583,A little help?,5,10/11/2021 13:00,My SoundCloud account glitched and I can only see my oldest 2 playlists and my latest ones. Can you fix this please? And thanks for the app. It’s really good nonetheless ^^
1584,The adds after every other song,2,11/18/2021 7:58,I have been a fan of sound cloud for years but the other population of the adds popping up it gets annoying and yes that’s how the artist get there money but they never used to be this many it’s literally every other song now.....
1585,Really good but…,4,10/23/2021 22:44,Don’t get me wrong this app is good but I need help with something. On my Lock Screen I have a bid music notification showing the music I was just playing and it’s annoying I don’t know how to get rid of it!.
1586,To many advertisements,3,10/16/2021 18:08,Way they many advertisements in the middle it ruin it and why is 2 double ads a thing is annoying specially if your playing music in the car for your family
1587,Best outlet for new music,5,9/7/2021 19:25,I love all the new music this app has introduced me to.  You can find good music from all around the world.  Great way to get away from all the mundane pop.
1588,Platform,5,7/4/2021 18:51,"My son has been making music (middlechild251) and SoundCloud has been great for him. He can get his music heard, while supporting other artists."
1589,Too many ads,4,8/8/2021 21:28,"Hey, ive been using soundcloud for awhile and i have to say. I am SOMEWHAT satisfied. You can listen to music with no pressure whatsoever, however its not satisfying to hear so many ads at one time. Please reconsider to do something."
1590,Comments,4,7/23/2021 6:25,I feel like people shouldn’t be able to comment on the songs because they are being rude to others and saying racist things
1591,Comment section,4,7/20/2021 23:45,Can you please have the app more free upload unlimited free please artist use this to blow up and also have the comment section off option free please because we artist can’t support hate

1595,So much new music and artist,5,12/23/2020 6:34,I love being able to find new artists and the artists I all ready know good app would recommend
1596,This app is awesome!,5,12/7/2020 1:16,This app has music no other app has! And it also carries popular music. I use this app almost every day. 10/10 highly recommend
1597,Horrible insight addition,3,12/9/2020 18:20,"The app is nice if you only listen to music, horrible for content creators, they had a really good app in SoundCloud pulse but dismissed it for a WAY less insightful section they they deem to be better, i cant even check the dates of the days i released a song."

1599,Fantastical,5,11/10/2020 1:11,If you need a quick pick me up. Drop this app on your device. You’ll be fantastically satisfied. Current music for the right mood and it will hit the spot. COVID mental medication
1600,uhhhh,3,11/20/2020 14:39,I like SoundCloud a lot because it has a lot of different versions of songs but for some reason when I play a song it will randomly stop or when I’m in class it will start playing out of the blue for no reason
1601,Widget,5,11/7/2020 15:39,I really love the app and the style but its missing widgets it would look good and while music is playing the widget will display the music picture and name just a suggestion.
1602,Great app,5,8/11/2020 2:40,"This app is great and all but some of my music is unavailable offline not most of the just a few, but I which that was fixed"
1603,Amazing app but..,5,8/8/2020 14:49,I love this app millions of songs I can listen to any song but the adds are extremely annoying I don’t have much to say about this app but yea.
1604,Love this app,5,7/6/2020 7:15,"I like this app so much because you can listen songs while your device is closed and you can like the songs you like, also songs from games and NCS."
1605,Great but,4,8/1/2020 4:05,"I’ve been using this app for around a year and it was great I had a playlist with over 300+ songs and out of no where that song only has 58 songs, i’m not sure why that happened but other than that’s it’s good"
1606,Great app but..,4,7/16/2020 9:13,"It’s a great app, with an easy to use interface but I’m still figuring out how it helps artists reach their target audience and or even make sales. They seem to profit from the content but the avg. person sharing their content doesn’t at all."
1607,Great app....some suggestions,5,5/22/2020 23:25,It would be great if we could replace uploaded sound files with updated/different sound files. I don’t want to delete the post to put up a new one.
1608,SoundCloud Go,1,6/14/2020 11:17,"So yesterday I was listing to my playlist with over 150+ songs on it and today when I go to listen to my playlist, almost every single song is now a preview and I would have to buy SoundCloud Go to listen to them. I do not want to buy SoundCloud Go just to listen to music I like. This is absolutely absurd and many people will delete this app because of this. Later SoundCloud 👋🏼"
1609,Problem,5,4/28/2020 11:00,After last update this application cancel itself automatically
1610,A Wonderful Place To Hear Great Preaching,5,4/23/2020 0:40,I love this app because it allows me to hear wonderful anointed preaching. The quality of sound is very good. It is easy to find the ministers through the search function. My favorites are Rev. Larry Booker and Rev. Johnny King.
1611,SoundclCloud,5,3/17/2020 3:16,I love this app so much you can find almost every single song you can think of even weird irrelevant songs like Spongebob songs I recommend this music app!!
1612,Soundcloud u da bomb,5,2/12/2020 5:56,It’s amazing! It doesn’t always use WiFi and the songs they publish are so cool. I have repeatedly been looking for an app like this and I have found it ! No regrets for using up my GB 😂🙃🙂
1613,Great app with little mistakes,4,3/7/2020 13:26,It’s great but it skips the songs sometimes and it also doesn’t have the right version of the song still a great music app to listen to your favorite songs
1614,Awesome for the most part..,4,3/2/2020 5:57,SoundCloud is amazing and so far the only issues I’ve encountered is lately it has a lot of lag and crashes a lot. It also occasionally stops my music altogether and restarts the app.
1615,Amazing,5,1/20/2020 15:41,Amazing app but you don’t always find the right song most of them are remixes but overall it’s really good you can listen online if you make a playlist.
1616,Having trouble signing in,3,2/5/2020 0:33,"Having a hard time logging in to my account every single time I try to log in a message pops up saying,                               

                                           “Error”
                  Sorry, we’ve had a server error. Please
                                           try again."
1617,Decent minus the adds,4,2/1/2020 16:25,"If there wasn’t that many ads after each song the app will be amazing but literally every song that you listen to, when it’s over there will be a stupid ad."
1618,"Amazing, but adds are irritating",4,1/21/2020 0:09,"The only thing that stops it from getting 5 stars in the increased amount of adds that have to be dealt with from an update a couple months ago, other than that, its amazing"
1619,Five Star :),5,1/17/2020 1:34,This app is honestly very impressive it has a variety of songs and lots of types of music and very good sound quality would definitely request to someone! :)
1620,I like sound cloud but I can’t escape people selling followers,3,1/19/2020 15:57,I feel like there’s no honest system out there providing a real platform for real followers they still have a ton of companies on this site selling algorithm  manipulation and that’s not the way to get followers - i wish someone was setting the standard
1621,Luv it!,5,7/6/2022 9:08,This app actually plays in the background for the iPhone.  I don’t even have to pay a premium service for it.
1622,SoundCloud review,2,9/2/2022 0:42,"This app is good for all the unreleased music however this is one of the most trash apps I have ever used. It freezes so much, doesn’t load songs I click on and is just slow to load everything in general they have to fix it it’s been like this for too long."
1623,Lagging issue,3,8/8/2022 5:06,"The app is great, but the only issue it’s irritating me is the lagging whenever you scroll. It didn’t have this issue before the updates but since around… 2019? It’s been laggy and still is, if not worse right now!"
1624,Help,5,6/13/2022 16:25,Love the app. Will choose over any other music app. But the most recent update hasn’t seemed to help the loading error for songs
1625,App keeps crashing for IPhone 11 Pro users. Please update it?,5,5/23/2022 22:11,App keeps crashing for IPhone 11 Pro users. I can’t play any song all the way through.
1626,"More music than anywhere else, Go+ spinning tracks on Engine Os is a great feature",5,5/12/2022 9:59,"More music than anywhere else, Go+ spinning tracks on Engine Os is a great feature"
1627,Can’t make another playlist due to update.,4,4/28/2022 3:56,"Cool app, been on & off with it for a few years now. Just paid for + & I can’t create a playlist, so whenever you guys aren’t busy, help a brother out would ya?🙏🏽"
1628,Just amazing,4,4/20/2022 23:41,"I love the app, but i cant listen to all my favorite songs because i don’t wanna buy the membership or whatever. In conclusion the app is amazing would definitely recommend to a friend."
1629,Music can’t work,1,4/20/2022 7:51,"I’m subscribed to the $15 plan a month with no ads and premium songs but with that I get a “Loading error” message for the songs I downloaded. I bought this package for the purpose of listening offline with no ads. In reality I have to pay more for music services than I do streaming service, just to get less."
1630,Best app ever,5,1/2/2022 19:51,It’s just a good app and has old songs you can all was come back to when your down please never take this out the App Store
1631,Sorry for the complaint again,5,12/10/2021 1:02,I know I right complates so can I fix it I probably says maybe 5 time can u fix it again
1632,Wow,5,8/8/2021 1:18,The only thing bad about this app is funny like everytime sc plays a random rapper that's not on my playlist is terrible but that's just hilarious but overall the app is perfect
1633,Charging issue,3,11/9/2021 23:33,I didnt have rnough money and it bounced which is fine but a couple days later i had money in my account for essential things and soundcloud decided to buy itself again is there a way to refund this
1634,Souncloud = peace,5,6/7/2021 17:27,Its really good allows up coming artist to get known and they have the latest songs and some better then the original so i like this app
1635,Organization,1,7/27/2021 1:02,"This has been a problem for a long time now and ultimately why i stopped using soundcloud, organizing your music is impossible and it is wayyyyy to easy to accidentally unlike a song and mess up your order, not to mention the app is buggy so that will mess up your order too and they give you no way to fix it"
1636,Good but fix this,4,7/3/2021 1:03,"SoundCloud has many songs or musics and I love them so much, but they kept pausing whenever I went to homepage on my iPad. 
Please fix this problem and hopefully I will put a five star. 
Thank you!"
1637,"love the app, however....",5,6/4/2021 22:50,....with Go+ users should be able to shuffle Downloads the same way we do Liked Tracks ☹️
1638,Awesome,5,6/2/2021 3:13,You don’t have to pay to be able to play music when your phone is off which is really nice
1639,Great app,5,2/22/2021 9:07,"Great music app. I like the wide variety of music, user friendly interface, and simple o features like playing music even when I’m not in the app."
1640,soundcloud is great but....,4,3/24/2021 5:19,there needs to be a way we can edit our playlist names and add pictures to make it the cover for the playlist. also there needs to be a scroll up and down button that you click so it’s faster to go all the way down or up in your playlist. and please make the editing quicker when you’re moving the track. going down is faster than going up for some reason.
1641,Way more ads than there used to be,3,2/25/2021 6:22,The ads are out of control. I am tempted to get rid of the app for this reason but all of my music is on there and isn’t on anything else. I’d say the ad frequency doubled or possibly tripled in the past couple years.
1642,Wow,5,12/25/2020 6:25,This app is amazing no ads no interruptions and it’s free also I can turn off my phone and still be able to listen to my music.
1643,Premium is to expensive,4,2/15/2021 2:00,I believe that the premium service could over a cheaper option for just downloading songs.
1644,For all y’all champs out there listen,5,12/8/2020 6:33,Y’all can create and our listen to your songs so what do you have to lose go head Champs do y’all thing ✊❤️
1645,Has too many ads,4,12/25/2020 0:23,Overall the app is good and I’ve been using it since I was little but there will sometimes be 2/2 ads that are 30 secs long so I recommend going ad free
1646,Amazing low internet use,5,12/4/2020 22:04,"Great to hear music without high internet consumption , great if you can work while playing music on the back."
1647,New world of Music,5,11/20/2020 4:31,Soundcloud let’s you find new artist all the time whenever you need new fresh music. All the way from Main stream to Underground.
1648,So Hard To Navigate!,2,11/21/2020 6:27,"I hunk this app has great potential.  I absolutely love the concept, but I cannot, for the life of me, navigate it!  How do I see a list of MY entire tracks?!  I only see partial and the ""view more most listened to"" or the ""see more recent"".  NO NO NO!  I want a list of ALL of them!  Is this possible?  I can't seem to find this!"
1649,Excellent,5,10/26/2020 6:06,It doesn’t have all original songs but it’s free and doesn’t have any ads constantly like other music apps❤️❤️❤️
1650,Been a listener for awhile,5,8/25/2020 16:43,"It’s great, it may take a couple of week or even a month for it too find some really good music. I find it great, every week has a new collection of music."
1651,Sound Cloud Review,5,8/12/2020 8:27,"It has been several months since I’ve been on SoundCloud. However, I like having different options to listen to music."
1652,Love,5,7/29/2020 1:36,"5 stars because there are not very many ads 
And you can play whatever song you want it does not pick the song for you"
1653,Wonderboy,5,7/17/2020 13:46,I love this app because I could put my music on a platform where people could notice me and I could find more upcoming artist sometime I wish you guys can remove unlimited uploads but this app isMarvelous
1654,New SoundCloud Go “Requirement”,1,7/27/2020 6:47,Very recently SoundCloud has made it so that you have to pay a subscription to listen to most songs on the app. If you don’t pay you can only listen to a 30 second preview of most songs. They have ruined the whole point of why most people got SoundCloud as it was the only good free place to listen to music.
1655,Has every song I love!,5,7/13/2020 23:40,"The only bad thing is adds but it’s reasonable without adds it can’t be free, and the good things: Has Every song, has Stations, Great Quality, and is made with Music!"
1656,MOST UBIQUE MUSIC PLATFORM,5,6/13/2020 22:52,"Has always brought me fantastic sounds from all over the world.  
Top hits are over rated.  The real jams are in those just made from the no ones few only know.  
Sounds cloud rocks, use it everyday."
1657,Great upload/sharing site,5,3/16/2020 9:04,Love he sound and the ease of uploading and sharing your music with friends to listen and listen to my latest projects .
1658,newest update is a big problem,4,6/11/2020 11:53,it use to be my all time favorite music streaming platform for a multitude of reasons but ever since a day ago I can't even open the app. it just sits on the loading screen forever
1659,Rating,3,5/13/2020 8:10,Access to great content but have to start listening to a recording in order to see title and can’t find any info on when something was created in the app. I kinda feel like I have to find the content I want on a computer then pull it up on the phone.
1660,Help me,4,3/30/2020 15:56,It was really good when I was able to use it but now when I try to login it just brings me back to where I was at the login screen. I’ve tried to delete it then reinstall it but it still doesn’t work. Pls help
1661,What happened?,1,3/22/2020 20:43,I love SoundCloud as I have found many underground song and artists I’ve never heard including a lot of famous artists like Gunna and lil baby which I have a lot of in my playlist that I listen to almost everyday. But now every single song in it became either unavailable in my country or is on SoundCloud go. It hurts that I had to delete the app but if the issue could be fixed I will gladly come back.
1662,One of my favs,5,1/31/2020 13:45,"Deffently trust worthy and helps you gain all your lost songs
Just wish I could put together my three accounts it messed with everything I didn’t know cuz I have disabitys"
1663,Please fix this..,3,2/27/2020 19:37,This app eventually signs you out and you can’t get back in saying you have the wrong password no matter what until it feels like working again one day... was even debating going go+ but not if I’m going to be locked out of my own purchases . Fix it .
1664,Best music player,5,1/13/2020 18:47,Its the best no ads and if you play a song 5 times is offline for free the only problem is that theres less offical stuff on here but its soundcloud so what you expect
1665,Barely any free songs...,3,1/7/2020 3:14,There are barely any free songs. only the rip off version of them are free which is  when soundCloud go users sing it and post it and it sounds like crap. So if you guys could make all the songs free and have SoundCloud go be to only make the songs I would rate you 5 stars
1666,Why’s the app crashing??,3,1/3/2020 9:48,"I use go+ and most of the time when i remove a song from a playlist, or sometimes when i’m just searching for songs the app decides to crash on me. This has been a thing for a while now, but its gotten a lot worse. This needs a fix."
1667,Official And Reliable,5,9/7/2022 13:24,"My BF has used SoundCloud for years and so have I, It’s great for all types of audio and eve offline listening. It’s definitely worth the download"
1668,4,4,6/29/2022 5:48,I give it a four stars because I can only play 2 song then a ad will pop up and it will continue and I get in anointing because i just want to listen to som song
1669,Playing issues,3,7/29/2022 20:25,"This is a great app for known and unknown artists but for some reason no songs will play unless you are on wifi, no songs play with data or even the subscription the app so this app is useless unless I’m at home"
1670,Needs some fixes,4,6/17/2022 15:11,The app is very good I use it all the time and have been doing so for years but recently the new updates have had a lot of bugs. Please fix this
1671,5.175,4,6/13/2022 16:47,Like the new interface. I prefer some aspects of the older versions like sliding to delete off a playlist. Also half of my library wont play after updating :/ Goat app though
1672,New update has issues,3,6/13/2022 17:15,"I love the app everything has been great for last couple of years ! However, this new update in 2022 (June)has been the worst !!!! the app will just freeze. Won’t let me search music or play my saved music"
1673,Major UI changes,3,6/9/2022 17:20,"You made major changes to the UI and didn’t even note it in the update section. You just had the generic message, no notice, and no option to keep the old layout. Weird…"
1674,So is this Normal?,5,3/27/2022 21:56,SoundCloud pls fix the bug where it logs u out and u can’t sign in. Pls. I might actually delete the App if u don’t fix this Pls do it as soon as possible. Thank You!
1675,I miss how SoundCloud used to be,3,5/15/2022 8:12,Always been a fan of SoundCloud bt you shouldn't have to pay for anything on here I miss the original SoundCloud artists just want to express themselves and be heard... I wish y’all would pay artist n certification us n protect masters we need it forreal
1676,Time,5,1/18/2022 7:17,I’ve been using sc for a long time now easy 4-5 years and i prefer the simplicity of it compared to newer apps 10/10
1677,I hope SoundCloud stays around forever,5,12/31/2021 20:28,I’ve been using this app for about 8 years now. The algorithm is fire and the tracks are too ofc.
1678,Amazing!,5,11/6/2021 13:14,No interrupting ads in the middle of tracks٫ only in between songs. If you are considering downloading٫ I recommend you do!
1679,I love it so much,5,10/9/2021 18:53,"I used to have it but my PeRAnTs deleted it, I use it one google Nd I’m 13 now and I LOVE ghost and pals, they don’t list ALL there songs on the app Music so I use it to listen to it,I love this app TYSM for making it"
1680,Wonderful songs on this app!,5,7/19/2021 22:55,"I use SoundCloud when I’m in my car, listening to my favorite song On there"
1681,Alex,5,7/14/2021 19:13,I love listening to music on here the ads can get a lil annoying but I’m glad there’s not to many and that you can always find cool remixes of you fav song
1682,SoundCloud is the best,5,7/2/2021 19:55,I love SoundCloud it’s awesome how u can literally ply any song but u can replay the same song and just really good I recommend SoundCloud over anything else
1683,It’s good but it’s buggy right now,4,7/14/2021 11:44,"I’m using it on a 11 max pro, and it’s buggy. I can’t go through my listening history or recently played. I really wish you could fix this early."
1684,Great app,5,12/10/2020 1:28,I would give this five stars because you can go offline and that want I have been looking for in a free music app with no subscriptions.👍🏽
1685,Listening history,4,5/14/2021 19:44,I love that I can listen to pretty much what ever song I want but lately I can’t open my listening history so I have to go and search for the exact song I want.
1686,Non-stop annoyances,1,3/2/2021 16:58,"Every time I open the app some full screen notification takes over, often with a non-obvious close button, completely blocking me from playing audio. 
Also, the app has no controls for skipping audio. Everybody else has the ability to skip backward or forward some amount of time."
1687,This app is terrible!,1,3/1/2021 19:49,"This is the nicest thing I can say about this app.
It’s like a very poor flea market, everything is posted by random people, half of it is either fake or just not there. And worst of all, it’s all in like CD quality audio. Plus, there’s many bugs, I can’t like and download music anymore, it will like for a second, start downloading and just stop."
1688,Stops working for iPhone 6,1,1/12/2021 16:12,"I have an iPhone 6, but the app now requires iOS 13.0. iPhone 6es only run 12.5.

I can download a previous version of the app, but it only takes a day or two before the app won’t start anymore, and I have to delete it and redownload to use it. I’ve had to do so a number of times now... it’s getting frustrating"
1689,A Lovely Platform,5,9/16/2020 5:08,I only wish there were additional space for free in the beginning for all accounts.
1690,Glitch?,4,11/17/2020 18:04,I love that i can upload music so easily but sometimes my songs just don’t show up on my profile page so mabye some one can fix it its not to bad though
1691,Won’t let me in,3,10/9/2020 19:20,"I downloaded because an artist in TikTok made a sound and put it on this app. But every time I tried signing up, it said there was an error in the system. I even tried changing my age to 18 but that still didn’t work."
1692,Great app!,5,8/3/2020 1:59,"I love this app! It has all your favorite songs! Although, I have trouble skipping the 30 second ads, maybe you guys could fix that? Besides that I love the app! Definitely a 5-star app! ❤️❤️"
1693,😎,5,6/19/2020 11:49,"Really liked the app I can stream danganronpa music, indie, rock, all kinds of genre. Even anime openings. It’s a little glitchy on my phone, but that might be because I don’t have a lot of storage. But it’s an overall good app"
1694,Great app,5,6/7/2020 17:32,"I don't know what is happening but when I want to like a song it doesn't let me, I give a like and it automatically removes my like, it start happening since yesterday"
1695,Best App but there’s a problem,3,6/17/2020 22:43,"I very Love this app but I cannot download any music while using Cross DJ or other DJs that support soundcloud, all I need is downloading offbrand musics or instrumentals to use karaoke or party all because of this new feature “Soundcloud Go+” and I can’t get on any offbrand Music that are not Go+."
1696,ADD QUEUE TO THE MOBILE APP,5,5/27/2020 19:38,SoundCloud’s great just make it so you can add to queue on the mobile app it’s no fear of programming it’d take two seconds the heck are y’all doing so y’all even care is it a premium feature what kind of dark tyranny is this
1697,This app is great,5,5/13/2020 22:47,"Great for music especially without having to pay for the service, although there are ads which are expected."
1698,Every good App,5,5/12/2020 11:25,This app has so many different songs but it sometimes doesn’t have the specific song you want but other then that it is a really good app. I love it
1699,SoundCloud,5,1/15/2020 18:41,"WOW! This app is amazing, I would recommend this app to anyone. I use this app every chance I get! I use this when I get in the shower, walk to the deli, and even to help me FALL ASLEEP! THIS IS THE BEST MUSIC APP EVER! Can this get any better? I think this is the best app of the century!"
1700,Monthly listening limit,2,5/10/2020 23:21,"I’ve been using soundcloud since my 8th grade year (just graduated high school now)
and i was listening to music and it popped up you have reached your monthly listening limit. Which has never happened before. i waited a month and all of my songs didn’t reset and at least 75% of my music is locked."
1701,"Usually is great, but...",4,5/5/2020 16:44,"I don’t know if it came with a new update or something, but SoundCloud crashes frequently, especially as soon as I click on a new track, but sometimes just randomly too."
1702,Downloads,4,4/11/2020 16:28,Love the app but lately all my music i auve downloaded just randomly undownloads itself for no reason and it take like an entire day to re download all of it because there’s so much. really frustrated that it does that for no reason
1703,3,4,4/4/2020 6:14,Kinda sad that almost all the songs on my playlist switched over to SoundCloud go over night and now I barely have any music to listen to plz take SoundCloud go away 🥺😭
1704,Soundcloud playlist turned all my songs to go songs,2,3/10/2020 21:07,Soooo um i was listening to my liked songs this morning and I turned SoundCloud off to go to class. When I went to listen to my songs again they ALL were SoundCloud go songs all of a sudden. So until u fix this problem I might have to go listen on another app.
1705,"Great app, Major Undeniable Flaw",3,1/26/2020 7:05,"Best unreleased music and low key music, highly underrated, talented rappers is what SoundCloud is about. But before I mention the obvious overuse of ads, I want to introduce a reasonable idea. I want to introduce a Quick Mute Button that is on a corner of the screen at all times. Sometimes you just need a convenient quick mute."
1706,To many 30 second ads,4,1/4/2020 4:53,Sometimes I am listening to sound cloud and there are 2 30 second ads which bothers me a lot because I want to get back to listening to my favorite music
1707,HOW MUCH I LOVE SOUNDCLOUD,5,8/23/2022 17:32,"Absolutely amazing performance. It’s a decent app, with pretty few ads in between song sessions without premium. I’ve been using it since I found out about it."
1708,Playlisting,5,7/13/2022 21:25,When are y’all gonna make it to where you can change the name of a personal playlist?
1709,Forced Video Ads,1,8/15/2022 17:39,"This app forces its listeners to “watch” video advertisements. If the user try’s to lock their phone or go to the Home Screen, the ad pauses and the user is essentially locked out of listening to their music. This is a hazard for people driving on the road and shows a complete disconnect between the developers and user experience. Please fix!"
1710,Supports the Underdawgs,5,4/20/2022 1:06,"Say what you want about SoundCloud but this is the only place that connects the music makers with the listeners. If you're into Djs, house music, dubstep, edm or  remixes you'll find it first on SoundCloud."
1711,Fix my sound rn,2,7/7/2022 0:16,For some reason on my account the bass is messed up but when I go other accounts it’s fine (or at least on some of them). It’s annoying. And it’s only on my songs. Ik it have nothing to do with how I make my beats cause when I get premium it’s fine. Fix this crap
1712,Important update!,2,7/1/2022 1:25,"I’ve been using this app since 2010, yet with all the updates theirs has yet to be a UI refresh, equalizer implemented, or at the least SoundCloud + free feature through paid advertising. Time to wake up and catch up before you get replaced with something better! 🤦🏽‍♂️"
1713,The New Update,4,6/20/2022 8:29,How come I can’t clear my listening history and recently played anymore ever since the new update? Please give the option to do this back.
1714,App does not work. Don’t use until fixed,1,6/13/2022 16:23,All of my songs are gone. My playlists are gone. Everything is gone. You make thousands of dollars. SoundCloud you are truly pathetic because you can’t even have your own app work. I’ve never had any issues until your update. I will keep it at one star until you fix your app!.
1715,Pls fix stream for more than a week,2,5/25/2022 21:05,I’ve been using this app for years and the new music stream has easily been broken for more time than it’s been working. I’m not a developer but every other app on the face of the earth has figured out how to do a timeline and I give u guys a lot of money. Thx
1716,Aiiyy,4,5/19/2022 14:18,Good app really like that we could also move the liked song like when we make a playlist we could put a song on a play where we like it
1717,the new update look..,3,5/3/2022 15:07,I prefer when the song covers were smaller and hearts weren’t white.. overall the app is the same as always and it’s fine besides that. Please let us change the layout/format of the app.
1718,✌️HECK YAH,5,4/10/2022 5:16,"My music listening app cuz it has all the music I ever need! Most unrated, underexposed music app in my opinion. I would love to be able to get the word out about this app."
1719,Great app and very cool unique tunes,5,2/5/2022 2:44,"Love the app and the tunes I can find here. While you can listen to to mainstream music, i love the gems I can find here and nowhere else. Highly recommend."
1720,Add playback speed control,5,1/27/2022 10:16,I mainly use SoundCloud to listen to podcasts wish it has playback speed control.
1721,It’s a nice app!,4,1/31/2022 3:19,I have been using this app for awhile now and it’s been great but I have noticed that I will try to shuffle play music and it won’t play my music even though I have 2 or more bars.
1722,Lovely App!,5,11/22/2021 20:08,"I’ve been using Soundcloud for around four years now and honestly, I can’t think of any criticism for it! Definitely five stars for me!"
1723,SoundCloud,5,7/12/2021 0:59,Very good has songs that I can’t find anywhere else and plays even when I’m not on the app is a very helpful app
1724,Nice,5,3/17/2021 0:49,It’s so good cuz you can hear everything and you can turn of your phone or anything you use and your music won’t stop
1725,How to access my uploads?,1,6/5/2021 7:13,"Where are they? I’ve looked everywhere on the app. Which icon? There’s home. Not there. Stream? Not there. Search? Nope. Library? Seems like the obvious place, but wrong again. Everything but. Go+? Here’s a subscription! Please tell me where I can find them. I can see one of them under recently listened, but beyond that I’m at a loss. Pretty frustrating."
1726,All good but,3,4/1/2021 5:43,"It’s a pretty good app but I’ve came across a bug to where when I try to edit any playlist I have, then I get an internet connection error and cancels my edits. My internet connection was great every time I checked to see the problem."
1727,Kudzoo Music,5,12/26/2020 12:04,"...It’s hard, on any platform, for an upcoming unknown artist or creator to be noticed/heard..well it seems to me, SoundCloud makes a good effort at leveling the playing field..granted I’m new to SoundCloud but so far so good 👍"
1728,Good but to many ads,4,12/26/2020 23:41,This app is amazing but when I skip or out on a new song it puts in very long ads and after one song plays a ad please fix it
1729,This app is awsome,5,11/5/2020 22:55,This app is awesome but guys if you have not considered asking the lord in your heart then do it because he will always be with you and love you it no matter what any one else thinks ☺️😀😇
1730,Decent,3,12/17/2020 23:57,After the last update it’s been crashing and I can’t see my recently played plus I’m starting to get ads after every song. I’ve tried to delete and reinstall but it hasn’t been working.
1731,Crashing,1,12/8/2020 13:47,Im not sure why but the past few days my apps been crashing just after a few songs play and it just does it over and over and I can’t seem to get any support from within the app I’m assuming it started with the last update y’all did so if you will please look into this that would be great thanks
1732,4.5 stars,4,12/7/2020 5:14,"This app is amazing. I use this app EVERY night but the constant updates delay my music listening and in some cases I even have to get rid of almost all my apps. In short, good app, too many updates."
1733,I feel like,4,11/26/2020 2:54,This app should recommend me more of the music i like and listen to and the genres that entails on the homepage rather then it being in some playlist somewhere that it auto generates for me.
1734,Loving app but adds,5,10/31/2020 16:17,I’m loving the app a lot but there’s to many adds and I also want to listen to music while watching my basketball videos
1735,Good app,5,10/13/2020 2:54,I think if you understand how the app works it’s great!! There r perks like being able to turn off ur screen and still here the music!!
1736,Good app but...,3,10/27/2020 12:30,It’s a pretty good app for music artists but it needs an option for tracks that people don’t like or wouldn’t want to hear since it apparently has an algorithm that appeals to person music interest please add a do not play again option
1737,Solution for music that hasn’t made it out yet,5,9/30/2020 14:36,Now I have somewhere to put my unofficial music until it gets out
1738,Fix it,3,10/4/2020 23:00,Bruh I love this app but sometimes the music won’t play after 2 seconds and it won’t let me on the app for no reason at all so I have to uninstall it or turn off my phone and turn It on again several times
1739,Best app ever,5,9/24/2020 2:05,It’s a good app you don’t need WiFi or internet to play music 🎶 it’s a good app but some little glitches and bugs that can me fix but Ohter then that it’s a good app not going to lie ❤️❤️🐣
1740,Great,5,8/5/2020 3:02,It showed me new music or music you don’t have access to on regular apps. You can search for underrated or new artist as well. The ads ain’t that bad compared to my other music apps
1741,Deleting my songs on my playlist,3,9/19/2020 16:34,I’m buying the full version and some how this app is still deleting most of my downloaded music also I can add any more songs to my playlist and I have less than 325 songs
1742,Ads,3,8/29/2020 3:04,I’ve been using this app for about 2 years now up until recently it’s been great but now there are ads every 2 songs and some of the ads are literally just the sound nails on a chalkboard with a no vaping slogan at the end. Not much more to be said.
1743,Garbage,1,7/31/2020 3:20,"updated review:

Time to delete.  Audius, hearthis, mixcloud are where its at.

Old review

After 5 years of this app being stripped down almost nothing, and turning it into a breeding ground for soundcloud mumble rappers, perhaps there is hope that it will turn into a proper music player again.  A music player where one can easily view and navigate to the artist or song that they liked and saved, instead of it being just a large, meaningless wall, and endless playlists...

There is music I have saved and liked over the years that I simply can get to because I can't go to artists or songs unless I save them to a playlist, or remember their names..."
1744,Denise Tapia,5,6/22/2020 3:57,"It is the app that I use the most when it comes to listening to music. It has all the music I like and love. It has all the type of genres, songs, raps, basically al the types of music"
1745,Trash,2,6/25/2020 13:26,If you like to listen to two adds after every song and if you like having a app that crashes literally every time you use a different app at the same time then soundclouds for you lol. This app used to be good now its just adds and the app is slow and glitchy
1746,Soundcloud:,5,1/17/2020 19:31,Well I thought the ree kids tortinos song wasn’t there so I said if I find the song ima give 5 stars to this app so apparently it apeared and y’all are my first app rating so yeah y’all having my five stars
1747,Every song is premium,4,6/15/2020 20:45,Soundcloud is great for new rap and all but now it made it so every single song on every one of my playlists is GO so i can only listen to previews. It worked perfect for a year or so but now i cant listen at all.
1748,TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE,3,5/31/2020 23:05,"I only use SoundCloud to stream music , when I’m using it on my computer it works perfectly fine but when I’m using it on my phone it crashes almost every time , and it freezes up when I try to scroll through my likes . Please clean this up . Thank you"
1749,XBOX,3,4/2/2020 6:23,"on my phone, it never turns off by itself or just shuts down or anything. but on my xbox it just shuts off the music & closes itself out. i’ve been using soundcloud on my phones & tablets for years though, so i still stick with you guys. just fix the glitch on the console."
1750,Log in / log out,3,3/11/2020 1:48,"The app keeps kicking me out, logging me off and I have to log back in to re-download the music that I have had downloaded before. Gets really annoying when you're trying to listen to music and then it kicks you off. 

Fix it."
1751,SoundCloud ❤️,5,1/4/2020 17:49,The only thing I do not like about SoundCloud is the accessibility to the artist there should be more usage allowed of statistics especially after you go pro . It feels like the logistics is off
1752,Apple Watch app is needed,5,8/31/2022 23:34,Great app filled with amazing music. I just wish there was an app for my Apple Watch.  I don’t always want to bring my phone with me on runs.
1753,Why does it say someone likes my music but it has no views,4,9/5/2022 13:06,"Ughhhhh soundcloud why when I get a notification saying someone has liked my stuff and when I go to my profile it says zero views 

Btw my name is XDZMZ"
1754,Can’t see likes or follows,1,8/27/2022 12:33,I used to be able to see who’s liked my track and who’s followed me but now it doesn’t show up. I get the notification on my phone but when I go to check it says I have no new notifications to view. I get at least a few likes every hour and it’s fun to see who’s listening but now I can’t see anything.
1755,Latest update,1,6/13/2022 15:09,The latest update completely deleted all of my songs and downloaded playlist. Had over a year of songs on there and now they are all gone. Plus i can’t search any songs because it just says “oops try again later” I’m on WiFi and everything but nothing is working
1756,Apple Watch,5,4/12/2022 1:13,When are y’all going to make this app on out for the Apple Watch I wouldn’t love to leave my phone when I’m jogging or just exercising
1757,SoundCloud,4,4/23/2022 13:14,Love the app definitely a music change for artists&etc wish there weren’t ads every other song but I’m just 2 broke 2 pay
1758,Best music app,5,4/2/2022 10:44,Really good All though you have a bit to many ads you have the best quality music to listen to
1759,smartwatch,5,1/8/2022 18:43,I love this app very much but I think this app should be available on smartwatches???? i don’t know but i would like to enjoy this app on my smart watch
1760,Good,4,2/17/2022 20:05,"It’s really good, but it would be better if they disabled links for the comment section, because most songs I’ve listened to, the comments are polluted with inappropriate websites, that can give you viruses and contain p."
1761,Great,4,2/12/2022 12:56,"2 things I wish this app had. Better accessibility to player options, specifically infinite play over only repeating the playlist. And integrated option for airplay."
1762,Best way to get your music out,5,9/29/2021 15:45,Love this app since the beginning of it. Been faithful to this platform it has helped me out in so many ways as a Dj tryin to make a name for himself !!! Love yu guys @ soundcloud
1763,To many ads,2,11/23/2021 2:00,"Been a Soundcloud user for 8+ years but these ads now since the recent updates are getting out of control. Way to many ads, if i were to rate the app years back I would rate it a 5 but i have been disappointed recently."
1764,ARTIST PROFILES,4,11/19/2021 2:55,Why did you guys make it so you can’t click the artist name or even click the “Go to Artist Profile” button? I legit have to search the artist in order to go to their page.
1765,Amazing app!,5,7/27/2021 4:40,I love this app better then half the free music apps out here. Plus the subscription doesn’t cost that much money and is totally worth it. SoundCloud on top 🤝.
1766,It’s ok,3,9/1/2021 0:24,I got the app thinking there would be no adds and there where some and it was tolerable but now there is so many ads and there’s so long so I’m trying to listen to music and I can’t because most the time I’m listening to ads
1767,Sucky UX,1,8/21/2021 23:05,What’s the number one use case for this app? Someone listening to some song on the radio and they hurry and download it and try to see who sings it and what the song is called. Yea well that just happened to me and I got stuck on the stupid create account part which kept throwing an error and the songs now gone. Epic fail. Just let me identify a dang song for Christ sakes.
1768,Awesome! Works well,5,6/27/2021 23:15,This app has every song you can imagine and works great for offline if you get the subscription!
1769,Sign in needs work,1,7/3/2021 1:18,"I was on the internet version and suddenly kicked off my account, I tried to make a new one and as soon as I tried to change the name of the new account it kicked me off. Both of my accounts were deleted I think.
I tried to sign up for another account but it said that I couldn’t sign up. Please fix this >:("
1770,Very good and helpful,5,6/13/2021 14:55,Sound cloud is amazing you can listen to song while your playing a game .I highly recommend SoundCloud
1771,Ashton Lavallie’s review,5,6/7/2021 21:42,Best music app if u like underground artist along with all of the biggest and also not having to use WiFi to listen to your music playlist
1772,Better than Apple Music,5,4/23/2021 9:00,Sound cloud has more features and more songs than Apple Music does
1773,View Info,3,6/5/2021 12:19,"Can we bring back the view track info option? Maybe I’m missing something but I now have to go to web to see the details behind track upload, producer, etc."
1774,Shuffle,4,5/1/2021 16:13,Make it so we can shuffle our playlist after selecting a song. If I shuffle my playlist then choose a song to play it cancels the shuffle. Love the app but this always annoyed me
1775,Great platform!,5,4/21/2021 22:59,There are so many fantastic little to unknown artists on this platform. I enjoy finding gems here that I can’t find in any other realm.
1776,Great App,5,2/22/2021 15:52,I haven't been using it long however it's user friendly and Great selection can't ask for anything better! Great app 2021.
1777,Amazing just a few problems,4,3/13/2021 14:55,I love it I just don't like how you have to get the membership to download songs and also ever Sence three days ago I can’t like anything pls fix
1778,Likes dont work,5,2/15/2021 21:21,I cant like songs anymore it doesnt let me love that app and all! But can you fix that bug thank you!
1779,Very easy app for podcasts,5,12/22/2020 21:44,The SoundCloud app has a great number of historical podcasts and that is my main use for it. It is pretty slick and works well.
1780,Good but some things...,4,12/26/2020 15:07,"The visual only ads locking you to watch the ad only until it lets you skip or ends is absolute garbage and is stupid, AND sometimes the app is very laggy. Other than that, yeah it's good"
1781,Best Music App,5,10/26/2020 23:59,2020 brought a lot more ads but I totally recommend this music app. So awsome you can choose songs you want to listen too at anytime
1782,Quit playing random artists,1,11/6/2020 15:06,Was great until they added the feature when you search an artist it’ll play one song from the artist then jump to a bunch of random songs when I only wanted to listen to that artist it’s very annoying constantly having to open the app to play a different song
1783,Comments,5,10/18/2020 23:14,"I Love Soundcloud, but I wish the comments weren’t visible while trying to look at the Cover Art. The classic version was better."
1784,Filtering,5,10/16/2020 17:12,"We love soundcloud in Iran, but unfortunately  soundcloud has been filtered by the government. I wish you could add some feature for bypass filtering on next update."
1785,Best songs ever,5,10/6/2020 13:25,"Guys in this app there are very good song y’all should get the app because it has good songs,Plus I use this app when I shower and when I am sad lol."
1786,I just don’t know,5,9/11/2020 20:18,Cool app and all but every 30 seconds now it’ll stop playing my music and reload the app and I just wanna listen to music tbh
1787,My rating,5,8/16/2020 23:46,"Soundcloud is definitely up there in music apps, it’s easy to navigate. On browser too, and the quality of sound is nice."
1788,Wonderful app,5,5/15/2020 1:46,Strongly recommend it....I’ve found songs on here that I love and that I wouldn’t find elsewhere...sound quality is great too...If you love music and want to acquire new music get this app.
1789,Okay app,2,8/6/2020 19:27,"Soundcloud go is not worth $11 plus dollars a month it constantly glitches and kicks me out of the app. And the worst part is they don’t even let you cancel the membership in app so they keep charging me each month and taxing me
Overall a bad app not worth getting SoundCloud go you should switch over to another music app"
1790,two little problems i’ve been facing for a while but never talked about,3,7/27/2020 8:43,so like it says above there i’ve been facing these problems and decided to talk about them first one is when i’m trying to add a song to my playlist i cant find other playlists that i made before it’s like they’re gone so i had to make a new one second problem is when i’m scrolling up and down it lags and i don’t like it so if you could please fix this problem that would be appreciated :)
1791,Update making it crash?,4,7/16/2020 18:14,"I love Soundcloud to make playlists of my own music and check out other artists. But it started crashing yesterday, which is when the app was supposedly updated. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
1792,Pizza rolls,4,5/25/2020 4:11,"Honestly the app itself is fine, it’s just that once in a while every song gets switched to soundcloud go and won’t switch back for a while. That’s really the only issue I have with it"
1793,Sound cloud,5,5/6/2020 23:12,"I think this rlly good not only can you find music that you want and listen to it offline!! You can find new artist and new music. It’s a must download,not to mention offline is free."
1794,Not right music.,4,5/11/2020 0:13,So I love this app because of the no-WiFi listening part and the listening to it without actually being on the app. But lots of the music are remixes which I don’t like. I want the actual song not a remix.
1795,SoundCloud,5,5/6/2020 13:51,I wish they would cut down on the vape ads but I love this app it has the best selection of music and small artists that I love to discover I use it so often it’s the best music app in my opinion.
1796,so many songs !!!!,5,3/27/2020 23:30,"this app literally has all of the songs I’ve been looking for, it also has artists like SadBoyProlific, Powfu and Rxseboy their songs are fire thanks for all y’all do 👊😎"
1797,Never hear the same artist twice,3,3/27/2020 23:45,"I love all of the music on SoundCloud, especially all of the covers. But how come when you start a station, you NEVER get another song by the same artist you based the station on? I’m all for discovering new music but this doesn’t make sense."
1798,Canceled pro,5,3/1/2020 23:08,"I canceled the pro trial and it said I will be getting a refund but I haven’t gotten one. I canceled on the same hour too. I really couldn’t afford it, I’m low in money"
1799,I love SoundCloud,5,2/7/2020 0:02,"I’ve always used SoundCloud over anything, I hope to continue to use it as long as progressive updates are made to make SoundCloud better."
1800,Unfair,3,1/30/2020 19:06,"It’s kinda unfair that SoundCloud gives you a “monthly limit” of songs that don’t require SoundCloud go. They should make plenty of money from all the ads they include. If they wanna keep people on the app, forcing them to buy premium is not the way to go. Other than that, good app for music."
1801,Joey,5,7/12/2022 7:20,"I love it , I spend hours listening to different song , I almost stop saving song on my phone memory"
1802,WHAT HAPPEN TO MY LIKED-MUSIC LIBRARY?!?!,1,8/25/2022 4:17,"I don’t understand what is going on, I came on to the app and saw my likes-library missing a few songs. I reloaded the page and the ENTIRE THING WAS UNLIKE, ALL MY SONGS- GONE!!! 

I even tested its, (still confused) I liked one song, reload the page, and the song was GONE!! 

I better see the next bug fix be able to bring back my 100 SONG PLAYLIST!!!"
1803,Can’t shuffle playlist,4,8/14/2022 9:29,PLEASE fix this bug in the app that’s not letting my shuffle my playlist. Everything was fine up until the most recent update.
1804,I love it,5,7/8/2022 14:52,Perfect there’s a lot of songs on SoundCloud that’s not on no other app so check it out you won’t be disappointed
1805,Love the new update,5,6/18/2022 17:45,It looks way more organized and overall an improvement.
1806,Sound cloud review,5,5/29/2022 20:03,Enjoy the many choices of many different types of music and plenty of hits nothing but enjoyment
1807,Bad update,3,6/13/2022 15:20,I have been using SoundCloud for years. For some strange reason the more recent update messed up my entire SoundCloud it won’t let me look up music or anything this has never happened before.
1808,SoundCloud Connection,5,4/16/2022 4:16,"I like how your able to have a good place to post your music and don’t have to pay a dime, and gain followers.😊"
1809,Good,5,3/22/2022 22:44,I like it but sometimes whenever I try to look back up a song it never pops up
1810,I love this app,5,3/3/2022 19:10,It’s been a dope app for me I can post my own songs on it and find other cool artist but the ONLY thing I miss is the messaging. PLEASE put that back on mobile
1811,glitch,5,1/18/2022 19:36,it has a big and it’s making me so mad. every time I open the app it just glitches
1812,"Good app, but…",2,2/10/2022 15:43,"I’ve been using soundcloud for about 3 years now, but recently i haven’t been able to listen to songs offline?? Was it in a recent update that you have to buy soundcloud GO to be able to use the offline feature now? Or is it just a bug?"
1813,Liked tracks?,1,2/1/2022 16:51,I would give it five stars I love SoundCloud I’ve been using it for 5 years almost now and it’s been my go to music platform but just recently I’ve been trying to like music and it likes it then I likes it right away and I just don’t understand why it’s happening I pay for SoundCloud plus so this is just frustrating
1814,Love the app but..,4,1/22/2022 19:25,"For some reason I am not able to upload music, I only have three songs and they’re all about 2-3 minutes long. I assume this is a bug, pls fix it soon😥😓"
1815,Been Using this App for Years,5,1/16/2022 11:34,I’ve been using SoundCloud for years - literally! 3-4 years at this point. Always have loved it
1816,Prioritie’s,5,1/3/2022 1:13,"I mean it just provides something more interesting than regular music that’s it, you can’t get better music everyday."
1817,5 stars,5,1/2/2022 18:13,SoundCloud is lit because I can turn my phone off and music still playing and it’s audio is amazing
1818,Wont let me like songs,5,11/5/2021 16:01,App is very good but one thing is sometimes the app won’t allow me to like songs to put in my like playlist. PLEASE FIX
1819,Subscription problems,4,12/14/2021 13:57,I subscribed to the SoundCloud go+ and it wasn’t working when it said I could listen offline. It’s a great app but I don’t get everything it’s saying I should be.
1820,Adds bro,4,12/1/2021 14:43,"Stop with all the adds I understand one here and there but I’m getting back to back double adds song after song it’s an add like what the heck I don’t want to hear ab how I shouldn’t vape, I don’t!!"
1821,There’s actually GOOD music here!,5,10/13/2021 1:08,It’s not easy to find but there’s better music here than I’ve been able to find elsewhere.
1822,Yo great app but I need an update,5,10/9/2021 17:06,"Can you guys add viewing the music queued by swiping up on the current song?

Or just add the feature of queue I can tell what’s next"
1823,Great App,5,9/3/2021 23:35,It let’s you skip as many times as you want and few adds. Best music app out there. Highly recommended.
1824,Bugs,5,7/25/2021 18:44,Fix your app it keeps bugging every time I open the account that has pro unlimited.
1825,Love the app please develop an Apple Watch compatible GUI,4,8/20/2021 17:53,This service is great. I am happy to pay the ~14 bucks a month for ad free + feature. I just wish that I could access all the features on my Apple Watch.
1826,Update issue,4,8/17/2021 4:50,"It’s a great app I’ve used it for years but the new update is glitched and it won’t go away so if you could fix that as soon as you could that would be nice, thanks!"
1827,Amazing,5,6/4/2021 2:26,Amazing it is free you can buy go plus but other than that it is free and you can listen with your screen off!
1828,Glitchy,1,6/19/2021 7:52,Can you guys fix the glitch for iPhone users where it says loading error for every single song I try to play? I’ve tried to do everything I can to fix it so it must be a glitch on your end. Can’t listen to music at all anymore & I couldn’t find a customer support section on your app so I had to leave a review 😒
1829,This Need To Be More Better,4,6/9/2021 12:36,The Thing Is About SoundCloud Is That I Can Listen To Music Offline And Ummm... It Won’t Work.. I Listened To Music Online.. And I Cannot Make The Music Downloaded Offline.. Without Using SoundCloud Go+ So Please Do Your Jobs Better Guys
1830,Love it,5,4/30/2021 18:25,This app has every thing I want out of a music app. I can turn my screen off and it still runs. 5 stars
1831,‼️🛑Read this 🟥🟥,4,5/7/2021 1:51,I love this app and i use it every day but there is something missing if you add this app in apple car play i will appreciate that and add feature to improve the app to the best plz take my review
1832,Phenomenal App!!!,5,4/26/2021 18:52,"SoundCloud is an amazing App.... especially if you are a fan of EDM music. Don’t mess around around, just get the paid version of this App!! You will thank me later"
1833,Love it but,5,3/30/2021 5:00,I love SoundCloud but it’s probably because of my phone but when I have to update the app I have to un install the app but overall it’s a really good and awesome app
1834,This is really cool app,5,1/16/2021 3:58,I think it’s cool cuz I got this app 2 years ago and I got my account back right when I got on and I now can here my taste of music back then I think it’s cool
1835,SoundCloud,4,3/3/2021 16:38,"Everything about SoundCloud is great, but the only problem is that you have to be in the app for an advertisement to play. That’s the one downside for me, everything else is good!"
1836,Nothing will load,1,3/2/2021 16:04,"I leave soundcloud on as background so I can sleep and for almost over a week now 90% of what I listen to wont load. It asks me to ""tap to retry"" and when I tap it doesn't work. The home page and find are the same way and I can't even change or look at my profile without it doing the same"
1837,I luv it,4,2/16/2021 18:22,Don’t worry I love this app! But I think you should allow us to edit our playlist names on the app instead of going through a bunch of stuff on  google and stuff....
1838,Great for listening to music,5,1/13/2021 0:33,My friends out their songs on here and I can keep up with their work
1839,Perfect,5,1/4/2021 11:54,"This is great especially for me it’s free and works really well I’d say it’s the best music app and I 10/10 recommend this for people who are cheap like me, keep on the good work!"
1840,favorite music app!,5,12/6/2020 21:19,my favorite music app! but i don’t know if it’s my iPhone 12 pro or soundcloud app itself but it keeps closing by itself :(
1841,SoundCloud,5,12/3/2020 18:49,"I love this but not all the songs are the same for the real songs, but it's re best any body who sees this u are making a right choice😊😊😊☺️"
1842,Audio Life,5,10/31/2020 14:45,A must have when it comes to music for both main stream and new upcoming artists.
1843,This app is amazing,5,5/18/2020 10:55,I thought this app would just be a waste of time that you had to pay for everything but I was blown away by all the.  Cool people and awesome features of the spp
1844,Great App Unfortunately Infested with Ads,3,9/2/2020 1:30,The amount of ads lately in the app is absolutely ridiculous. I’m starting to consider using a different app for music other than SoundCloud because of it. I remember when I first had the app and there were barely any ads at all.
1845,Offline,3,8/6/2020 2:25,It’s nice that you can listen to your music offline but some songs don’t work even tho it’s offline music and it can get really annoying looking for the songs that work and the songs that don’t.
1846,Ruined your own app🤦🏽‍♂️,4,8/2/2020 15:19,I can’t even listen to my favorite songs anymore because they’re on GO+ for whatever reason use to like SoundCloud now it’s just a trash music app
1847,Great,4,6/12/2020 20:58,All-around great app just recently I had a problem loading in the app but I fixed it by deleting it and re-downloading it so it’s all good now i’ve had to Apple for four years and I haven’t had any problems
1848,Music’s great!,5,2/19/2020 2:33,The music is super great! I like how I could go on a different Apps and listen to what I want and I could have my phone off so when I’m going somewhere I don’t have to keep it on
1849,I’ll HAVE to..,1,4/29/2020 1:33,"..(WAAAS going to) leave the “rating with stars” until the issue of being able to use iOS version 12.2.x because, until 2 days ago, I was able to use the app... but I cant submit UNLESS I do. 
NOW, I cant even get passed the ORANGE full screen color-
*CRASHES*
... AAAND back to home screen!
I dont know what you were playing around with when you updated but I suppose I’ll pay for a sub with another music app.
Heard bad things and waited til a month ago to try this app. Its not MY fault APPLE likes to ASSume everyone has a computer/laptop/tablet, with that, developers should at LEAST leave a whole version LOWER than the 1 current version. 
Whelp, onward & to the NEEEXT 1, it IS!"
1850,.,3,4/3/2020 17:42,"My main issue is that it constantly crashes. After I just play a few songs, it’ll crash and then I’ll have to watch an ad again.
Besides that the sound quality is decent and it’s an alright app, just needs bug fixes."
1851,Pls fix it,3,3/16/2020 8:26,"Please fix it! I put a song in my playlist and then it cant go ofline, it finally worked after i tried to deleted it and put it in a couple of time 😠 but that is so annoying when i have to do it with a whole playlist!"
1852,Ads,4,3/9/2020 14:47,The only thing I hate a about this is if you don’t have premium you get a +20 second ad and sometimes it’s two ads that are +20 seconds. It’s a music cmon atleast 10 seconds would be fine but 20 that’s just dumb🤦🏻‍♂️
1853,Easy to use,5,1/29/2020 3:42,There’s barely any ads and you get almost any song you want even knew releases within the week they’ve been released
1854,Freezes over and over,1,1/27/2020 4:30,"For the pass week the app keeps freezing, once I’m in the app 15 seconds later it freezes.

Update on the app, it still continues to freeze I press 2 buttons and it freezes. Highly frustrating as I having my music that I want to promote and I have go to my pc to do anything. I have been with SoundCloud since 2011 but this app is horrible. FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1855,THEY LISTEN<3,5,8/15/2022 16:34,my favorite music app hadda write a review askin to fix a bug and developers were quickly responsive. fixed in a few days baby soundcloud is the BEST
1856,Can’t search right now,4,8/16/2022 4:41,Love the app but there’s a weird bug right now where you can’t search a song without it plastering a Go+ ad in your face. Very frustrating!
1857,I love using the app on traps,5,8/14/2022 3:50,Content of your device you still hear the music so I recommend downloading the app
1858,Rated a 5,5,8/9/2022 3:21,"Really good, recommend it, even with ads, the ads are just like 30 sec and you get them rarely."
1859,It works better then you tube,5,8/5/2022 1:05,Great player app compared to even paid for apps and services.
1860,Sound cloud,5,12/7/2021 1:49,It’s a good app and has pretty much many songs that you won’t find on Apple Music or something
1861,Honest Opinion,1,7/4/2022 1:17,"After using SC for 3+ years I can confidently say it is the worst music service I have used. The selection of music is lackluster and basic services require the premium. They do not care about your listening experience, and the user interface is just a mess. Ive had good times with the app but it has been downhill since installation."
1862,Love the app but fix this glitch where the app unlikes songs,4,6/26/2022 21:46,Love the app but the glitch is back where if you try to like a song the app unlikes it and then the app crashes please fix this
1863,No.,2,6/13/2022 15:08,"So the new update doesn’t let me play any music that wasn’t downloaded, even though I have service and wifi. Also way too thick of a new font. also my playlists won’t even show up and i’ve had the app since 2016 and i didn’t delete any of them"
1864,New update,2,6/13/2022 14:32,The app was fine as it was. The new update doesn’t load some music. My own personal tracks have also disappeared. The new music tab and stations and etc. also do not load. Would prefer for everything to be reconsidered and touched up. Much appreciation.
1865,What’s happening!?,2,3/13/2022 16:24,Love this app and have been using it forever with premium and student but recently it’s been glitching. I downloaded songs in high quality audio and now any time I move away from the app screen it will shut the app off?? Can this bug get fixed pleaae
1866,Mobile App doesn’t support Spatial Audio,2,3/4/2022 3:28,Spatial Audio for AirPods Pro doesn’t work with the mobile app. Only desktop etc. As a regular uploader it’s very annoying when almost everyone is listening to your songs via earbuds etc nowadays through mobiles and spatial audio isn’t supported.
1867,Song removal,1,1/10/2022 18:40,"Stop removing song cause when you do, it still shows thats its in the app and then when i go to unlike it it gets moved back to the top of my like list, this has to be fixed cause then your app glitches out then I'm stuck on listening to ads cause its then counting the unplayable song as a listened song."
1868,Not being able to go to aritists pages to search for new music,1,12/21/2021 8:30,I don’t know if the same thing is happening with everyone but if I’m shuffling a station trying to find new music I can’t click on the actual persons name and be sent to their profile anymore..I absolutely hate this and I’m praying SoundCloud fixes this horrible issue
1869,Possible issue,4,11/24/2021 21:07,"So, I’ve had the app for a while and I can’t figure out why the loop playlist button isn’t on mobile. Is there something I’m missing?"
1870,Please fix,3,12/3/2021 6:19,I have been trying to post songs and it tells me I need to verify my email I pressed to send me a new verification email and it never sends me the email and I’m stuck without posting the song I wanna post please fix this
1871,Idk,3,12/1/2021 0:06,"Overall good app but when i like songs they unlike for some reason and the songs aren't even removed for copyright i can click on it and listen to the song but i cant like it, it likes then dislikes it self"
1872,Why? 5 Stars,5,11/20/2021 5:11,I’ve been a user of SoundCloud since the day it was available. Experience has been convenient & fair.
1873,Organization,3,11/21/2021 23:14,SoundCloud needs to have a feature to rearrange the songs in a playlist instead of removing the songs and adding them back into the playlist
1874,¡Read me!,5,10/10/2021 14:39,Thank you for me being able to play my music like a celebrity on this platform my main ;)
1875,Hard to cancel sub,4,11/8/2021 22:47,"Good service. Really enjoyed it, however, hard to cancel subscription from phone. Had to use a desktop"
1876,Love it,5,9/27/2021 21:18,This is the best but don’t addd songs when people make a playlist and it would be better
1877,MC Sneeze Guard,5,8/5/2021 7:33,"My number one go to playlist,,,tell your friends, tell your family! Off the top, left to right , straight up and down..get money!!!"
1878,There’s a glitch for me!!,4,8/26/2021 15:33,"Whenever I like songs, it doesn’t add to my library!! Is anybody having a problem with this too!!?? Overall this app is good to listen to music!!"
1879,Awesome but,4,8/25/2021 13:45,Please make it possible to change tracks from a different device using the same account! That would be amazing.
1880,I LOVE THIS APP BRUH,5,5/3/2021 15:08,"Free music, no ads that you actually have to listen to, can choose any song, etc. Only thing i don’t like is that i cant find some songs"
1881,Tbh SoundCloud used to be good,2,6/24/2021 5:22,"First off I hate how you cant close the app without the ads stopping, it makes my blood BOIL. And second, SoundCloud used to have like 1-2 ads after like 8 songs, now it has like 3 ads after like 2 songs, I literally cannot stand this just let me listen to music I don’t wanna get MCDONALDS🙁"
1882,Great app!,5,3/3/2021 18:47,Sound cloud let’s you post you’re music and you can listen too some music for free! What else can you ask for?
1883,Copyright,2,4/14/2021 14:04,"It’s great, but whenever I upload something that thousands of other people have uploaded, only my stuff gets taken down. Mine stuff is slightly more edited than others and still my stuff is taken down, like I’m targeted and everyone else can do whatever."
1884,Excellent !!!,5,1/14/2021 17:35,Excellent music app. you can listen to different and direct music from its authors. With good headphones you have hours of entertainment and discovery. The sound tends to be very good!
1885,Now it’s just an app that I used to love. 😂🐐,3,2/27/2021 21:44,"But anyhoo, Soundcloud is a free digital music service that launched in 2007, and tanked in 2020. 

I used to be able to listen to songs without it taking me to the “Sign-up, I already have an account,” screen. Then that stopped. So, to listen to music, I’d Google, “soundcloud.” And it’d redirect me to the app. Then that stopped.

And I can’t loop on Kindle. 

So now I am stuck with no iPhone 5 Parody by Jacksfilms, for hours on loop in my EarPods. (Everybody calls em earbuds, but they’re called EarPods.

So please fix this.🤦🏽‍♀️🙄😡😒"
1886,"Great app, dont change!",5,1/8/2021 2:27,This is such a great app! I remember when I stopped using it but i came back because no one else gives services like this! Im capping btw

1891,Not bad,3,10/22/2020 10:41,I would give it 5 stars if the adds weren’t so bad. sometimes there really annoying when there’s a 30 second add that you can’t skip then a second one pops up after that one.
1892,Simple and nice,5,9/23/2020 21:53,"I can listen to music and go on other apps at the same time, its ad free and, i can choose what song i want to listen too! I love it<3"

1895,Ads ruin it,3,9/3/2020 18:11,"This app is my favorite music app and I use it all the time. BUT THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY ADS. I’m starting to get double 30s ads, ads after almost every song, and double ads more often. I do NOT want to buy a subscription and I feel like they are forcing it with the amount of ads. I JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO MUSIC WITHOUT SOME ANNOYING AF AD RUINING MY VIBE"
1896,Thank you,5,7/19/2020 7:35,Thank you for the update I am very happy with the app now I can listen to my music now don’t have to worry about my app not working thank you for fixing the app
1897,Add a play next option,5,4/30/2020 15:52,A play next option should be available for songs
1898,Not super easy to navigate but better than Facebook,4,7/7/2020 18:19,"I really like the level of metal tracks available. That said, you shouldn’t allow the nasty comments. Too much hate going on in the world as it is."
1899,Why isn’t this added already?,2,6/21/2020 16:04,"I love using this app but a suggestion I have is to add a feature that lets you add songs to the top instead of the the bottom of your playlist, this is a pretty simple thing to add but it hasn’t been done yet, ever time I see an update for this app is bug fixes that didn’t even do anything."
1900,Amazing,5,4/6/2020 13:50,This app is so much better than most because it’s free I recommend this app to anyone who likes to choose their own songs and to make music
1901,Torii aleaxander opinion,5,3/27/2020 20:15,My opinion is that you should put more of people’s song that just dropped put it in a perfect section of new thing and new type
1902,I love it !😍,5,3/5/2020 5:15,"All the time I always wanna find nice calm cool sounds and sound cloud helped me find songs like drama ,cool, and awesome music! Hopefully you will get to see , hear, and feel ho I feel!

Sound Cloud keep up the good work!😍😃"
1903,Not Downloading,5,1/16/2020 15:48,I had this app for years and when I changed over my phone to a new phone the app deleted and now It will not let me download this app on my phone . 😡🔥
1904,Features,4,3/3/2020 23:52,"I really don’t have any complaints about this app at all, but I do think you guys should add a tool where artist can tag other artist as a feature on their track. That way more people get exposure."
1905,Deleted songs,1,3/2/2020 21:09,"I have been compiling my songs list for over 3 years, to find out today that more than half of my songs are gone, and I find this to be ridiculous, to say the least! I’m not sure how this works, but whatever the reason is, you should notify us that our list (or part of it) will be deleted and give us a choice."
1906,Go+,3,2/28/2020 17:47,Soundcloud is great love it. But after a little on most of my songs it gives me a preview so i buy Soundcloud Go+ and i can’t listen to my favorite music but after a while it goes away but it just gets annoying. I just want to listen to music and not buy Go+
1907,SoundCloud,5,1/7/2020 22:08,"I can find the music I want, and find songs that I’ve never heard. It’s so easy to build a playlist, and listen to other playlists."
1908,SoundClouds review.,5,1/5/2020 19:30,"Very good app, can play music anywhere, all day long. Just heart the song you like or make a playlist and click it too play. Recommend it 100%! Have a great day!"
1909,Can’t shuffle playlist,5,8/12/2022 16:09,Idk what’s wrong with the app rn but I can’t shuffle none of my playlist with out the SoundCloud go+ adds popping up
1910,Now glitchy,2,9/2/2022 0:16,It was doing great for a long time but now this recent update had made me unable to play and song saying there is an error every time I try to play a song and says try again later even though I’m connected to the internet
1911,Sound cloud I’m begging you,4,8/26/2022 14:03,Pleaseeee please pleaseeeeeee make it so we can edit our liked songs because some songs get taken down and i wanna put it in a certain place
1912,Like Limit,1,8/21/2022 2:22,"Why is the only way to remove the like limit  to go on your computer and click out on the notification when 99% of people don’t use SoundCloud on computer… why even have a like limit when SoundCloud bots don’t effect anything , seriously if we pay for SoundCloud Go  then we’re not a robot."
1913,Wish i could message & more,4,8/16/2022 21:30,"Haven’t found it at least. I post audio and message others, would love to have that"
1914,Clearing history and recently played,5,7/31/2022 0:00,"Can you guys add the clear history option thanks,and cleared recently played."
1915,One of my favorite music apps.  .   .,5,6/19/2022 17:35,"Been rocking w SoundCloud since day one. Before the ads, and the commercials. They still are one of the best."
1916,I love this app just needs updated,5,5/25/2022 2:07,"SoundCloud is amazing, diligent and independent only problem is the app crashes suddenly sometimes. Regardless I love this app."
1917,Newest update is horrible,1,6/13/2022 14:02,I’ve had SoundCloud for years now and I love it and it worked perfectly before. But now with the new update it won’t even let me listen to my music. Something always pops up saying “loading error” every time I go to listen to music. Hopefully these issues and bugs get fixed
1918,request plz :),5,2/20/2022 11:38,THE APP IS FIRE!! of course but my request is to add dms to phones not just desktops plz. I don’t always get to have my laptop because I can’t travel with it. :(
1919,Regarding New Update,5,2/16/2022 15:03,"The new interface is a lot more user friendly, as well as being more cosmetically pleasing. Please keep it"
1920,Very very very good,5,12/23/2021 12:51,I have had it since it came out and I love it never a problem it lets me listen to my favorite songs and makes me HAPPY.
1921,Video ads never got fixed,1,1/29/2022 5:31,"How does an application which allows users to move to other apps while playing music think its a good idea to have some unskippable ads which pause any time you leave the app? It’s been like this for months.
I love the website, but if this doesn’t get fixed soon I’m uninstalling this app."
1922,Soundcloud = <3,5,11/5/2021 5:26,"sound cloud allows me to post my songs to the whole world in the matter of seconds, for free, for that 10/10 !"
1923,Too many ads,3,11/24/2021 23:36,"As of late, I've been getting unskippable ads every 2-3 songs. Having ads is fine, but the fact they're shown so often makes it a problem"
1924,This app is the best app,5,9/19/2021 22:43,For those people who want new music come here. This app helps people who are music creators get the fan base that they need . Thanks an they are good for beginners too
1925,Fixed the bugs,2,9/29/2021 5:28,I've used SoundCloud for about 5 years and it usually has problems but one of the glitches I hate is it skips a few songs when one song finishes and does it every single time. I can't enjoy a playlist or my liked audios 😕
1926,Great app,5,9/17/2021 0:51,Able to find songs I thought I could never find again!
1927,Everything is good except ads,5,7/15/2021 17:18,I found all the music I wanted but the ads are unbelievable. I DONT CARE ABOUT VERIZON. Just play my music. And they be 40 second un skippable ads
1928,Automatic,5,4/27/2021 1:02,Keeps going the song on while I close app or turn it off I keeps playing it!!
1929,Fix this bug,3,6/17/2021 4:37,"Whenever I’m listening to music it out the blew cuts out. Then whenever I pick a specific song it starts playing then stops, starts one more time then stop completely. Like why"
1930,Sound cloud thoughts,5,3/24/2021 23:49,This is probably my fav music app but a lot of my favs are I ether on GO+ or the OG I ain’t available. So plz make sound cloud GO free for users who are over 5 year supporters.
1931,Please fix,4,4/22/2021 12:30,The app keeps on crashing every time i play music and have the app running in the background its really getting annoying
1932,Amazing!!,5,3/23/2021 23:48,Has every song u can ever think of and more. I make music and post it to SoundCloud and it’s so straight foward and easy to use
1933,Social app,5,2/14/2021 3:08,Love the SoundCloud community. It’s really nice interacting with people who make such exquisite art. Reading how other people feel about a song I too love touches my soul.
1934,It’s good but one problem,4,3/8/2021 4:18,So I love how you can make a playlist of songs and stuff but I can’t change the album cover can you please help me. Other than that the app is awesome ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1935,Lots of music :),5,2/13/2021 5:04,There’s tons of different music and some when unreleased songs that sure isn’t right to listen to but it’s just so good yk
1936,Came here from Apple!,5,1/28/2021 5:51,"Life long ITunes member, but everyone keeps telling me I need to be here! So I’m learning how to do it!! Love that I can really show my support for smaller artists."
1937,Can’t go without,5,1/5/2021 18:48,Literally grew up listening to covers and mixes on this platform. I love it through and through.
1938,This app has gone to S#!*,1,1/21/2021 2:02,"Since when do I need to actively need to be on the app for ads to play through? Y’all just ruing this app left and right. This exactly why I went from solely using SoundCloud to paying for Apple Music. App used to be amazing, now I ten out of ten don’t recommend. No, it’s not cause of the ads, it’s because of the new policies and lack of net neutrality."
1939,"Good, but needs a fix?",4,1/6/2021 1:44,"I love SoundCloud, but all my personal playlists were cleared & I had a lot of important audios on them. There are too many that I just don’t feel like remaking/readding them all. 😕"
1940,Brings the World Together,5,11/14/2020 11:08,Love that it’s international. Content is varied. Depending on what you’re looking for you hear how we are more alike than different. Excellent platform!
1941,4 star due to commercials 😤,4,12/8/2020 13:27,I don’t like the commercials but u can pay to have them removed. Other then that really good way to listen to the latest to the oldest music
1942,It’s great but there are problems,4,12/5/2020 20:11,It’s a great app to use but it’s better if you pay for go+ which isn’t a big problem it’s just kinda annoying
1943,👌,5,10/19/2020 12:38,my friend said soundcloud had terrible quality when he hasn’t even tried it. It’s 👌
1944,As someone who had a hand in spreading this beautiful app he’ll yes I recommend it.,5,6/20/2020 23:49,An amazing app !!! I have used this app since it very first came out.  I’ll never use another platform :)
1945,Can u update it,3,9/8/2020 0:21,Honestly I’m tired of SoundCloud. Literally I can loop songs in my playlists. When it reaches the end it goes into another song that isn’t in my playlist. Can u make it so that it just PLAYS the song in my playlist
1946,This app needs updating,2,8/19/2020 13:10,This is a great app but it glitches alot like if you have to many songs its puts them all on soundcloud go and it’s annoying because you have to delete the app and make a new account. So all in saying is this app needs a better software update so it can be more sufficient for us users.
1947,I suggest this app for listening to music but not for downloading music,4,8/15/2020 23:27,I like it but you have to pay to download music and I don’t really like it if you’re downloading this app for listening then I recommend this app.
1948,Love it but it has a bug,4,7/19/2020 0:55,I’ve been using the app for ever now but just recently it’s starting to glitch out and crash every time I use it and it won’t even let me listen to my music 😤 please fix this man
1949,Thank you for the fixed issue,5,5/7/2020 2:00,"Now it is all working well without any crashes, I'm happy that you fixed it."
1950,It’s and ok app,3,5/28/2020 2:35,I rate this app 3 stars bc the music is very good quality but for some reason sometimes the song you look up it doesn’t have the full song or the person who actually sings the song!! I recommend u find another app or u try this out but it’s an ohk for me!!!
1951,I’m not Spanish so stop making me listen to ads in Spanish,2,5/25/2020 15:32,I’m not Spanish so stop making me listen to ads in Spanish. I’m not being a racist or whatever but for all that is holy stop it. I don’t want to delete the app but it irks me so badly that I close your app as soon as I hear a language I don’t understand a word of. Make a way to change it please
1952,FIX IT PLEASE,2,3/31/2020 3:29,"I’ve listened to Soundcloud for YEARS already & for some reason, the app kicked me out and keeps asking for my login information when it’s the correct info. Keeps saying “error - sorry we couldn’t sign you in” now I can’t listen to all my music and I miss it!! Please please figure out this glitch so I can go back to using my app."
1953,SoundCloud problems,1,5/1/2020 19:43,SoundCloud is a cool app but there are a lot of problems with signing in and out. If I log out and try to sign back in it won’t let me. It’s really frustrating when you lose are your music just because SoundCloud doesn’t remember your login info. This is my second account I’ve made and now I have to start all over again and find new music.
1954,How SoundCloud scammed me,2,3/22/2020 15:52,I bought a yearlong Pro Unlimited account for “Occasionally Yes” and ended up doing a half-year of jail time.  I was locked up for being cute and having a hot girlfriend.  I called SoundCloud to be reimbursed for 6 months and they wouldn’t budge.  I could really use the $60 to avoid homelessness and being locked up in cities such as Danville for simply being homelass.
1955,Ads are out of control,2,3/5/2020 17:13,"It felt like overnight soundcloud got a ton of ads and it’s honestly annoying asf. i log on and the first thing i get is an ad, once the songs over another ad. if there weren’t so many this would be the number 1 app i’d be using due to its wide variety of great content. It’s very unfortunate that they had to do that :("
1956,Soundcloud,5,3/3/2020 17:53,I LOVE this app because I don’t have to pay for it and I can trim my phone off and the music will still play and it’s just amazing THX for making this app a thing
1957,B.A.U,5,2/11/2020 17:44,"I’m not just saying this because my music is on here, but SoundCloud is awesome. Whenever I’m down and need a pick me up, I can always count on SoundCloud to have a new artist with some amazing sounds."
1958,Self promotion,4,3/2/2020 13:49,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for a year now but I noticed there has a big problem with self promotion on big artist, the comments are spammed with people promoting them selves and it really annoying please fix this."
1959,Updated!,5,1/8/2020 22:27,This app has come a looong wayyy especially for IOS. I am very impressed with all the hard work SoundCloud has been doing to improve it. Thank you!
1960,One Problem,4,2/7/2020 17:50,Every thing is great except not being able to put your playlist on repeat is annoying. If you could fix it that would awesome.
1961,Love this app but the bugs,4,2/6/2020 14:35,See I love this app a lot I had it for a long time but I can’t even listen to the music anymore I play it and then it stops pls fix this quickly
1962,"I use it all the time, but might have to stop.",2,1/8/2020 17:13,"I absolutely love using this app, I literally use it like all the time... but now it seems that the app will no longer allow me to “like” a song. Whenever I try to, it will automatically remove the like and remove it from my liked song playlist. What gives???"
1963,Excellent app to connecting musicians,5,5/27/2022 3:57,"I use several platforms, I just started with SC and I’m very happy. This is a great place to share your original music"
1964,Playlist issue,3,9/2/2022 0:12,My playlists have zero tracks since the lastest update and the tracks do exist still. So I hop this problem can be fixed because I had these playlists for years. Thank you!
1965,New update,2,6/13/2022 14:00,The new update has a lot of bugs for instance none of the songs are loading for me anymore and clicking on the album cover doesn’t play the hole album and it doesn’t play other song after u finish the album.
1966,Lacking Features,4,6/11/2022 19:01,Doesn’t have all the features as it does online. Other than that it’s pretty good. I have no real problem with it.
1967,SoundCloud,5,5/24/2022 22:48,"If you have go this is an amazing music app they have everything. If you don’t have go I recommend, best investment of my life🙏"
1968,Such a good app you can almost find any song on here as well it’s incredible,5,4/30/2022 15:07,10-Oct
1969,In love!,5,4/14/2022 0:19,OMG I am in Love!!! There is soooooo many great things about this app! Only down side is you have to pay for premium for some songs overall an amazing app!
1970,All the songs I lost years ago,5,3/16/2022 1:26,Easy to use this site - finding songs I’ve missed
1971,Not working properly,1,4/5/2022 20:22,My “see more listening history” and “see more recently played” buttons don’t work and I’ve contacted support twice and troubleshooting isn’t working. I’ve deleted the app and re-downloaded it signed out and signed back in. I’ve tried signing in on browser. It’s not fixing… really unhappy with it..
1972,Title,3,3/23/2022 21:50,"It was really good, I used it for a couple of years and now all of a sudden it doesn’t play any of my music. It just stopped working. It used to be my main music that I’d use but now not so much, it doesn’t work like it used to. I’m really bummed."
1973,Free or paying,5,10/14/2021 0:10,Having it for free is nice not like those apps that spam ads just one every 2 song or even none I love it
1974,Absolutely love.,5,10/11/2021 3:55,I love this app. Every time I get a new phone or a new device I always get this app. Must have especially if you love discovering new music.
1975,1 problem,5,10/3/2021 17:15,All its missing is the fact you cant loop playlist add that then im telling you this would be popping
1976,Music stops playing randomly,3,10/10/2021 23:18,After subscribing to SoundCloud go + and downloading some songs on my likes playlist my music sounds low quality and stops playing out of nowhere now
1977,SoundCloud,5,9/23/2021 2:56,It’s has songs that you never new the artist your looking for post the songs
1978,I love soundcloud,5,9/8/2021 19:59,It allows me to be able to listen to my favorite artist without having to stay in the app! 👍🏼
1979,Um,5,5/23/2021 6:07,I love SoundCloud but I'm having an issue where I keep unliking the song and it keeps popping up still saying I have it liked what do I do?
1980,Complaint,3,8/25/2021 23:11,"I love love love this app, i personally think it is the best music app. There has been a new update, and now some of my favorite songs are blocked. Saying ""not available in your country"" i hope it is just a bug and not permanent."
1981,I can’t listen anymore,1,8/16/2021 18:30,since the latest update my sound cloud app keeps deleting itself and every time I try to download  it again it almost gets done downloading and then quits and won’t let me go on the app or anything. Sound cloud was the one app that I had to listen to music and now I can’t listen anymore.
1982,Updated,3,6/30/2021 12:56,"With most recent update, the option to put a playlist on repeat for mobile has been taken away and I find this most inconvenient"
1983,crashes often and won’t let you save songs sometimes.,3,6/24/2021 15:27,Sometimes when u save music it gets removed the library and then the app crashes.
1984,No track descriptions or way to search podcasts,1,6/21/2021 1:17,There is literally no way to view track descriptions on the app. The search feature continues to be a problem for SoundCloud. You get more and better results for what’s on SoundCloud by using google. There is also no way to narrow a search to just podcasts.
1985,Unknown,5,3/30/2021 14:31,Quality is best & ability to recommend other music based on what you listen to is amazing; especially underground & unknown bands/singers & songwriters!
1986,Music lives forever,5,2/4/2021 2:58,My cousin introduced me to SoundCloud. The whole concept behind SoundCloud is innovative. It’s a platform which help to promote music outside of syndicated radio!
1987,Good app too many ads,3,3/1/2021 22:27,Still 2 years since they made advertisements videos which you have to leave your phone open or it wount skip the ad. And no music videos on soundcloud.
1988,"Love, love, love SoundCloud",5,1/14/2021 15:20,"Brilliant, easy, fun. Saving my favorites and building stations creates a fluid, interactive experience with the app. Creating my dreamy sounds to dance through the days is so, so smooth."
1989,Best music app💯💯💯,5,12/31/2020 3:23,The app is so good but the problem is my old musics that I saved for offline doesn’t work sometimes plz fix this
1990,Gonna have good review,5,11/6/2020 22:08,I am 64 years old and I have a good experience in this app and I like how you can search up to 1000 songs I really love this app.
1991,Too many ads,2,12/12/2020 0:39,"Y’all fr need to fix this I barely listen to a song and I get an ad next and then 2 songs later another ad not just one but two then another 2,3 songs later and then another 1-2 ad like y’all need to fix that because it’s too much"
1992,I keep getting signed out,1,11/20/2020 19:45,I don’t know if I missed a update or something but I had so many songs liked on sound cloud I probably will never see again because how I got signed out for no reason at all and SoundCloud has to fix this because this happened to me THREE TIMES so I lost it and that was my last straw dealing with SoundCloud
1993,Best App Ever Invented.,5,10/16/2020 4:14,This is literally the goat of all apps. It changed the industry forever! If you’re starting off with music this is the place to go. Just give it a shot.❄️🔋
1994,Feedback,5,9/22/2020 18:09,"I love this app, it has everything song that I love!!  I really recommend it to anyone who is looking for a music app."
1995,Constant Crashes,1,10/1/2020 23:51,"Soundcloud crashes all the time, can’t listen to anything for more than 10 minutes. Also, after paying for a subscription for over a year, my offline downloads STILL disappear and won’t stay stored in the app. I’ve tried everything, and support can’t help me. Thanks for ruining music"
1996,AMAZING😸,5,8/30/2020 18:02,"I used this app while I was in school to work and it really helped. The classmates I had were extremely loud and when I used SoundCloud,it was like they were never there!"
1997,A soundcloud equalizer,4,9/3/2020 23:53,I love this app so much! But one thing I would love to have added is an equalizer. I want something I can use to bass boost my music and make it louder. I would love it if you could add an equalizer to the app. Thank you so much! Have a wonderful day!
1998,1OfTheXtreme,5,6/28/2020 2:20,"Beautiful in every way- the algorithms...  I’m a programmer; it’s simply refreshing to say the least in such a crazy world, nowadays...

Keep spreading the same belief in love; we agree with you...  we love you back..."
1999,My opinion,2,8/10/2020 5:50,Used to be great until the latest update where they made almost ever song a preview unless you upgrade to SoundCloud go what is way to expensive and there is an add almost every other song I’m getting closer and closer to only using pandora
2000,Advertisements,1,8/10/2020 3:06,"I’ve never written a review but after literally every song I get an advertisement, I want all of the people at SoundCloud to understand that it takes little to no effort for me to close the app and reopen it and I honestly don’t care how many times I have to do it. So yeah if the ads were less consistent and not repetitive then I would have no issue but teach is own."
2001,Everything on my playlist makes but SoundCloud go,2,7/1/2020 23:57,I was listening to music on my playlist and all of my songs let me listen to them without having to pay for SoundCloud go then the next day I was gonna listen to my playlist then 70 songs out of my 74 songs all hade the go+ on them
2002,House,5,5/29/2020 7:21,"For the last 10 yrs now I’ve been following some of my favorite DJ’s right here on SoundCloud that a friend of mine suggested I use to feel the need of good beats. Cindel, PAULO, serving ovahness... have made a many memories with me!

Thank you!"
2003,Would be a 5....,4,6/22/2020 3:45,I love the variety of music and I also pay for the premium service but the only complaint I have is that I cannot play music on different devices at the same time.
2004,Soundcloud review,3,6/20/2020 1:10,Soundcloud is great except for all the ads and there’s a monthly listening limit that I always run out of play time it has it on most well known songs but if you get SoundCloud go+ then you don’t have a monthly listening limit not ads
2005,One issue,3,6/4/2020 3:50,I only use SoundCloud for my music but one thing i don’t like is if i pay for the premium i can’t atleast stream from two devices on the same account at the same time. I wouldn’t mind paying the premium if i would be able to do that
2006,SoundCloud,5,4/21/2020 3:14,"SoundCloud is a unique platform allowing young artists the opportunity to broadcast their projects  before the world.

And producers should continue to leverage SoundCloud as a way to finding new and exciting artists, aka Bad Bunny."
2007,Amazing,5,4/17/2020 18:48,I just wish they could add a shuffle option to the playlists you make.
2008,Awesome,5,4/16/2020 19:02,I’ve climbed myself from the basement to the studio you can hear it in my tracks from the first to bang bang boom. Two weeks I’ve been a creator and I’m seeing growth. Thank you sound cloud.
2009,Lay out,5,3/24/2020 23:14,The app is good but it should look better when your playing a song more clean
2010,Love it,5,3/23/2020 3:18,It’s the best music app u can listen to a lot of things in different ways also!!!i love it cause u cans do other things while listening to ur favorite songs!!!!recomend to get it😌💗
2011,They have everything I need download it!!,5,2/28/2020 23:13,I have never searched up a song that wasn’t there download it it great!!!
2012,Good App! Needs more though.,4,3/19/2020 22:27,"Something Soundcloud could really use is a free Equalizer feature. I want to make my songs sound a little different and see how it works! Otherwise, the app runs very nicely."
2013,Too many ads and keep signing me off,1,2/11/2020 12:58,At one point I was using this app a lot. I noticed I stepped away and for some reasons. The ads are 30 seconds between every song. Almost everything requires SoundCloud go+. Then I keep getting signed out for no reason. Then it’s difficult to sign back in with the same password I just reset. This app is doing too much now.
2014,Queue?,2,2/10/2020 23:14,"How’re you gonna have a music app as big as SoundCloud and still not have the ability to queue songs, also the amount of ads you get on this app is ridiculous I would purchase SoundCloud + to remove them but why would I pay for an app when I can’t even play a song next"
2015,Laggy and ads too close together,3,1/27/2020 23:39,"I finally decided to update the app after not updating in four months, and this version is awful. It is laggy and has ads after every other song. Please fix this."
2016,Shuffle Does Not Actually Shuffle,2,8/14/2022 17:18,"Shuffle does not shuffle at random, I have easily 3000+ songs on my Soundcloud from years of use, but I literally hear the same ones every day. Even if i spam the shuffle button it still will end up on the same shuffle loop as before."
2017,Get SoundCloud Go,5,6/14/2022 14:57,It’s really good better than Apple Music and sound cloud go is just so much better than anything
2018,It’s an app for ad spam,2,8/8/2022 7:32,Every two songs it’s an ad. This used to be a great app to come and listing to music on. You killed it with all the ads you up load and some ads you have to sit there and watch them without them playing in the background
2019,Love it but constantly crashes,3,6/16/2022 20:08,I can listen sometimes for about 30 minutes but after that it crashes halfway into songs
2020,Excellent app!,5,6/2/2022 9:17,Really like how simple SoundCloud is to use. Just an overall solid music app that offers great album/artwork graphics
2021,Knox,5,5/22/2022 5:55,It’s really cool how are you doing listen to music and not have to worry about paying certain and has a really good music
2022,"Great app, great music!",5,4/1/2022 15:00,"So far, I’ve really enjoyed having this app on my iPhone. I use it every day and have had no problems with it."
2023,Cool,4,4/2/2022 20:38,"I like almost everything about SoundCloud, but I don’t like how it automatically goes to a different song after the song you chose ends."
2024,Only app I use,5,4/1/2022 2:50,Has all the old and new so we can all enjoy music while doing family time
2025,The ad problem,5,1/24/2022 6:25,I like it but the ads are killing me in the middle of a song and just hi do you want to protect your- like no just stop😣
2026,Streaming from Apple Watch,4,2/6/2022 16:55,Do you have any plans to add a feature to be able to stream directly from Apple Watch like other music apps?
2027,SoundCloud,5,1/11/2022 13:53,The app is amazing I’ve been using it for years and have never been disappointed at all I love the app and appreciate u guys
2028,Review,5,12/19/2021 5:42,I like to use this app when I’m trying to fall asleep. This app just hits different when listening to music
2029,Best music app,5,10/29/2021 0:30,Y’all should give people the option to like a song off the Lock Screen tho 🔥
2030,es feugo,5,10/28/2021 4:46,SoundCloud is my favorite app because it allows you to experience great songs and upcoming artist like Lil Peep that you won't hear anywhere else
2031,I love it,5,9/2/2021 13:43,I get to listen to all my favorite songs and other really good songs I haven't been able to.
2032,Playlist names,4,10/26/2021 10:51,I think you should be able to change playlist names from the app
2033,A pleased customer,5,8/19/2021 1:25,Thanks for allowing me of low budget to have a platform whereby I can advertise my small-time music. Thank you.
2034,"Great Music App, too many Ads",3,8/30/2021 0:27,"I love the selection of music and sings and albums you can find, but the app is slowly forcing you to buy the SoundCloud+ service simply by making you listen to 3 ads every 4 songs"
2035,Awesome Music App,5,7/30/2021 16:17,I love SoundCloud! Especially the fact that you can play the songs offline for free once you’ve listened to it once.
2036,song removal,4,7/15/2021 5:37,"so i love this app i use it on the daily, but soemthing that bothers me is when a song gets deleted and such , i try to remove/unlike it from my likes since i cant even hear it. and it unlikes and then appears at my recent likes. i don’t know if this only happens for me but it is super annoying, i’m pretty sure it’s just a bug but it ruins my listening experience and it’s been going on for the longest time."
2037,SoundCloud rocks,5,6/13/2021 23:43,I love being able to find all of my favorite artists in one place. And new ones.
2038,5 Star,5,6/9/2021 13:25,I love that the songs I have in a playlist will play without internet and the unreleased makes it the best music app
2039,Slow,5,5/21/2021 3:50,Why is the app so slow and glitchy? No other music apps I’ve used are like this
2040,Update this to work on new IOS!!,4,6/5/2021 23:51,Can’t believe developers have fell behind on this. Too many people use SoundCloud to have it not be compatible with newer IOS.
2041,Great app,5,5/6/2021 12:22,"This anything I could ask for. Few ads, lots of songs, and easy to use."
2042,5 stars,5,1/12/2021 23:17,This app is great for offline music listening much recommended for people who listen to music on the go.
2043,Fix,4,4/27/2021 1:30,"I love the app, but fix the bug songs have from being removed from liked playlists, it’s super annoying"
2044,"Disappointed, it’s all about $$$ now",1,4/10/2021 8:13,"Was loyal since 2010, it was a great app, until you made some tracks $$$, sorry, but I’m not paying that, coz I can find those tracks somewhere else to listen , and so won’t use your app anymore. And some tracks can’t play in my country which is absurd, coz I hear them on the radio and etc. Dissapointed."
2045,I,3,2/19/2021 4:48,I love this app but it forced me to sign in when I never need an account and it deleted all my data also for some reason my phone is up to date but it still says I need to up date my phone
2046,"SoundCloud is great, but...",2,2/18/2021 3:29,"I’m really not down with the kind of data this app collects. More than it needs to function just fine. It collects financial, contact, and “sensitive” information and is going to be called out for potentially tracking users across apps and monitoring usage outside of its own little cubicle. NOT COOL."
2047,App update for more .....,4,2/14/2021 22:25,"I wish the prices where more convenient,
viewing your messages on the app and the music saving can be more organized for music genre organizing"
2048,Great,5,12/16/2020 13:29,It’s really good because you can find so much songs and there’s so much albums and you can find leaked songs it’s great
2049,Playlist organization,4,1/6/2021 0:37,"Soundcloud is the best music app, but let us rearrange our playlist, not the songs in them but the actual playlist, then it’s perfect."
2050,Always solid,5,12/5/2020 19:12,"I go lengths of time without using this app but when I do, I always find it helpful and performing well."
2051,Sound cloud,5,11/28/2020 15:01,You are so amazing and I love the idea to listen to music even when your phone is off.
2052,Love the app but one thing,5,11/10/2020 16:21,"Great app for underground rappers, perhaps the best, BUT I’m not a fan of the whole limit for songs you can post without paying."
2053,"Great app, why aren’t you easier to navigate in my car?",4,11/12/2020 5:48,Make available on vehicle infotainment systems already! How are you guys this slow! Everything else is great!
2054,It works great but.....,4,11/11/2020 18:00,It works great but it is a little weird and hard to find new and music you like that is the only reason why I did do 4 stars but they have every artist and more great app🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼
2055,Rated it 3.3 stars but gave it 4,4,11/8/2020 23:17,It has some glitches and I wish I could have recorded some mixes I’ve been playing but I understand that there are reasons for why it’s not permitted
2056,Annoying ads,2,10/29/2020 17:34,I love this app! all the music i listen too but ever since last month longer and more ads starting to attack me i listen to 2 songs and 2 ads with 30 seconds come wasting my time. Please make ads less coming or less time.
2057,This app is pretty good :),5,7/23/2020 4:41,"This app haves one of the best Quality I’ve ever seen and in fact it’s free makes it even better, I 100% recommend this app."
2058,Underwhelming to say the least,2,10/26/2020 12:42,"If I get one more modal popover taking me away from what I’m doing I’m going to update to a one star review. Even without the worst modal UX in the history of apps (seriously, fire the team who thought those modals were a good idea) the app lags behind the desktop and has for years."
2059,soundcloud,3,10/1/2020 3:16,I love soundcloud but it logged me out and now i can’t log back in because it keeps saying error and now i’m mad because i lost all my music that i had on there and it won’t let me make a new account.
2060,Playlist,4,9/28/2020 21:26,Playlist limit should definitely be longer!
2061,Not bad but...,3,9/22/2020 23:39,A queue list option to see what songs you actually want to hear and not random music you didn’t choose. Also a repeat all option would be great as well.
2062,I have deleted the app,1,8/27/2020 19:25,"I had to delete the app because it asks me to openVideo advertisements when I’m driving.
In addition to the Spanish advertisementsI don’t speak or listen to Spanish songs 
Please if you are annoyed by video advertisements when you’re driving or by theStereotypalSpanish advertisements delete the app because this is the only way to pass your message"
2063,MJ,4,8/10/2020 2:18,"Great app use in daily, one thing that could be better is at least let the streaming quality be the same weather you pay or not. Other than that it’s 👍🏼"
2064,Best,4,7/26/2020 18:33,"Just a few big bugs that are annoying !
one is that I have a duplicate of my playlist in Mobile version my friend has experienced this too ! Need a fix please !
thank you ."
2065,The best music out here,5,7/18/2020 0:56,When you can’t find what you’re looking for you can always go to SoundCloud and they were have it.
2066,Great music app,5,6/22/2020 15:38,This app is one of the better music app in the App Store because it is easy to find new  artists that are maybe not famous but still make good music
2067,Insights are terrible,1,7/15/2020 18:55,"So, SoundCloud decided to take the stats from SoundCloud Pulse and include them in the main app as ‘Insights’ — great idea, except visually it’s much harder to read than Pulse due to not using bar graphs. To make matters worse, you can no longer view stats in Pulse — you’re forced to view your ‘insights’ in the main app. 

Pulse wasn’t a great app, but it worked, and worked much better than Insights."
2068,Great,5,5/30/2020 10:43,This app is great I play my fav songs here but I was editing my account and it wasn’t working maybe you can tell me what happened in your response thanks
2069,Perfect.,5,5/13/2020 7:06,"After fixing the crashes and a few other bugs, this app has became perfect! I love the selection and quality."
2070,"Nice app to listen to remixes, and support future artists",5,5/8/2020 13:59,"This is a great app to start your music career, and share your music to others who can listen, and criticize or help with supporting music ideas!"
2071,New Soundcloud update,5,5/6/2020 23:32,The new sound cloud update keeps crashing and wont let me in to listen to music!
2072,The company,5,3/15/2020 21:50,"There should be an Option to Merge Accounts, because people often forget their email and passwords!"
2073,Glitch/Bug?,1,5/4/2020 9:02,"My SoundCloud account “Spaztechs” has been under some type of bug where the songs I liked have been removed completely. I need this to be fixed for not only me, but for other users & our liked songs restored. This is very frustrating.
May 2020: The app keeps crashing after I play a song in my liked music. Please fix this."
2074,Eh,3,4/21/2020 22:03,The app is ok but one problem is that half the time I’m searching I never find the original song. There’s always a bunch of 12 yr olds just posting remixes n crap of the song causing me to spend hours of scrolling just to find the original song
2075,4 stars,4,3/3/2020 11:07,The app is good but when you search a song and play one song it will only play a lot of versions of the same song and I would recommend it to a friend if I had one ;c
2076,To many Ads,4,2/13/2020 14:05,Can try to give less ads because I’m trying to listen to music and a ad pops up after every song there are to many ads
2077,Rating on Soundcloud,5,2/7/2020 18:30,"fun app, like apple music a lot, but it’s a good alternative to it, good feature and thing is finding more underground artists on here, and trying to be successful, keep up the good work.
jake tolman"
2078,awesome,5,1/26/2020 4:36,"My friend showed it to me, and i saw there were barely any ads, and i was blown away at how much i could find that wasn’t on my previous music app (won’t name it)."
2079,Ads are becoming to much,3,2/3/2020 15:32,Been on here forever it’s annoying going from 15 seconds ads that you can skip to two 30 seconds ads back to back I could do one 15 sec no prob at one time not paying $15 a month to skip ads
2080,Good app but broken,4,1/31/2020 2:12,Everything works but the library. When I go to listen to my playlists it just closes the app and restarts it. Any way I can fix this? If not for the problem the app is really good.
2081,AMAZING! ONE OF THE BEST FOR STREAMING!,5,1/5/2020 21:31,Find unreleased tracks! A multitude of covers of your favorite songs! Remixes and tracks you’ve never heard before! I absolutely love it. The ads are to a minimum and it’s really quite great! A must have for a music enthusiast.
2082,Great platform,5,3/25/2022 16:43,Great platform only thing I don’t appreciate is them streaming are music and we don’t get paid for it 🙃
2083,Fix it please,1,9/2/2022 16:25,App is basically unusable now with it trying to advertise Go+ with every click. Can’t even play a song after searching for it because the ad pops up and then I have to research after exiting the ad then it happens in and endless loop of never getting to hear the song I searched and exiting ads
2084,Search Feature,2,8/28/2022 4:30,I noticed other people are having the same issue with the search button. Please fix this feature ASAP. We cannot play songs from the search button.
2085,Bugs bugs bugs,4,8/19/2022 23:28,"Snapchats with the Url take me to the website and the website brings me here, then it opens SoundCloud without the song… 

Also i can play songs off my likes, but get a Go+ pop up when i try to play the same songs in the search bar. 

For a while i couldn’t shuffle playlists, 

I already pay for no ads, just don’t let the site break down, i need it"
2086,"Decent app, but…",3,7/27/2022 6:11,"Decent app, but there’s a bug that doesn’t show your playlist/won’t let you add songs to it even though it’s there, but it will let you add songs to said playlist on desktop"
2087,Sc,5,3/11/2022 19:02,"Why does my music keep stopping, and why do I have to keep manually restarting the song. Please fix bug"
2088,AMAZING!!!,5,1/14/2022 15:59,"I’m so glad I can listen to my favorite songs, even offline without having to buy every single one!"
2089,Very frustrated,1,3/10/2022 23:30,i got a new phone. and i went to open sound cloud and it said the usual do you have an account of sign up so i signed in and it said “server error” so i tried to make a new account again “server error”. so i tried deleting it and re downloading it and you guessed it “ server error” so i guess i won’t use sound cloud so 🤷🏻‍♀️
2090,Great app! one request,4,3/8/2022 1:14,"Can there be a tracking system that tracks artists listened to, listening hours and such. Would be very appreciated"
2091,Bleh,3,1/16/2022 19:49,It’d be better if I didn’t need the app open for ads I understand needing to pay artists but the point of a lot of people using this app is to have our phones locked playing a playlist at work.
2092,Water1_1Doug,5,1/3/2022 3:07,Excellent way to download your tunes and share with your friends and your friends share there’s back
2093,Good app,4,12/8/2021 11:37,Sound cloud is a good app there is not a lot of adds If you want to play a sertent song you can but the only bad thing is you can’t play all of its song but overall it’s a good app
2094,?,1,12/18/2021 16:04,"Bro? what the **** i have been using this for years but these peloton and norwegian cruise ads BEYOND STUPID, they're big enough companies stop loathing in the money and play our music please. support artists not big companies. i remember when soundcloud didn't even have ads. now we get two, thanks. your making the music hard to listen to."
2095,They can work on getting the actual song,4,11/19/2021 4:15,They can work on getting the actual song
2096,Cant like songs,3,10/24/2021 18:18,The app is good but sometimes when I go to like a song it disappears from my likes list right after. The songs aren’t deleted but for whatever reason I cant save them
2097,Welp,1,9/28/2021 23:26,"Gives it’s own set of problems with loading and playing music, keeping things favorited, too many ads, double ads, unskippable ads not too boot(Likes to be in double ad form a lot if not every time. :) ) I lost music from my favorites list in the past because of this apps incapability to do what it is supposed to do."
2098,Ku,5,9/24/2021 7:31,Didn’t even know how much information they give artists hard not to support it
2099,PROBLEMS,5,9/22/2021 15:40,I like the app and all but whenever I’m listening to it I noticed it skips over some songs I am listining to please fix it
2100,It got trash,5,8/27/2021 22:57,You can’t listen to music with out wifi anymore I can’t use the app anymore
2101,"Amazing, but needs just one thing.",5,8/15/2021 3:15,The app is amazing but it is missing the song download button for IOS.
2102,From early,5,8/2/2021 20:55,I’ve been a huge supporter of SoundCloud from early. I really enjoy the improvements they are gradually making. It’s my jam w extra jam sauce.
2103,Messenger,1,8/3/2021 20:53,I rate 1 star due to the years SoundCloud ap has been around but there’s still no way for artists to communicate about their music on the road with out having to use other service platforms.  There’s no excuse overall why I can’t send & receive messages the same way I do on the website version
2104,Undiscovered gems,5,8/1/2021 17:49,Would never hear this kind of music anywhere else!
2105,Great for music podcasts!,5,7/22/2021 17:19,Easy to use app and features full-length music podcasts from awesome DJs. I use this to provide music for my house parties.
2106,Wide Variety,5,6/20/2021 0:33,"If there’s a song you fell in love with, and you can’t find it anywhere else...soundcloud has it:)"
2107,Rapchat Integration,4,7/16/2021 13:45,The use of SoundCloud alongside RapChat has been extremely convenient and easy! I wish my profile was more easily accessible but hey that’s just the interface.
2108,Can’t delete playlists…,3,7/12/2021 2:09,I’ve tried to delete playlists but they won’t go away. They alway come back for some reason. I like how I can have the app closed and still listen to music though.
2109,Very good ig,5,5/9/2021 4:59,"Love the app lol, the only thing i dont like about it is if you try to log in on a laptop it wont load. But beaides that its awesom and wish more people used it :)"
2110,WHYY.,3,5/25/2021 0:51,The liking is broken i keep on trying to like the stuff i listen to but it wont work it keeps on unliking it and im trying to find a way to stop this i tried restarting my phone logging back into my account. EVERYTHING please help
2111,Better than anything!,5,2/25/2021 21:59,It’s so good! Even though the adds are annoying they are amazing!
2112,Need to update!,3,4/15/2021 16:22,I am an artist and it would be VERY convenient to be able to access my messages & notifications. I don’t understand why this isn’t available when using the app.
2113,The update,4,3/22/2021 15:41,"Can you fix the update, just for u thing because it keeps showing the same music Artis and nothing changes."
2114,My opinion!!,5,1/28/2021 22:48,Great app I recommend! I use this app very often they even have slowed down music!! Amazing you should download it! If you want ofc:) <3.
2115,I love this app,5,1/4/2021 23:26,It’s so good you can listen to your fav songs and you can turn off your phone and it still plays I love it 💜
2116,Does anybody real even use SoundCloud anymore?,2,1/6/2021 16:59,The website is completely bombarded with spam and commercials are annoying. Can’t even read messages through the app! I wish there was another app like this one but there isn’t. 2 stars.
2117,Top notch,5,12/19/2020 6:12,"I’m the owner of the song goblin by justaguy_tk, I love SoundCloud, y’all go listen to my song it’s dope and thanks to the 8 followers I’ve y’all actually believed in me , thanks to SoundCloud"
2118,Incredible,5,11/22/2020 7:02,Awesome app. Started listening to post Malone when he only had 24k followers. Love listening to people with talent before they blow up
2119,I like you can turn off your phone and the song still plays,5,11/6/2020 18:09,Lol
2120,Its really awesome and you can make your own playlist,5,10/18/2020 12:40,i really love this app. i’ve used this app for about 1 year and a half and i love it!
2121,SoundCloud,5,7/30/2020 1:50,It is very nice to have SoundCloud plus. I take my phone with me and get to have the music with me anywhere I go. It always nice to know fs your getting the authentic songs
2122,Not working,1,10/13/2020 8:46,"I like soundcloud, I truly do. The only reason I’m leaving a negative review is because the app seems to be down. I can’t access an account or even create a new one. I tried to do this on the web as well, and the page never opened up. Hopefully you can get this fixed and then I’ll give the app 5 stars"
2123,It was great,4,9/30/2020 4:11,I love the app it is really great but I just HATE the constant ads like u listen to something there’s a ad after u listen to two more things ANOTHER AD but it is vey good app just not the constant ads
2124,I love it but..,4,8/30/2020 1:19,"I like using it but the ads keep coming up every Two songs! It talks about vaping. Kids use this they can’t vape!
Also Some of the songs That people post on Their Are Inapropriate for kids that use this."
2125,Problems,4,8/16/2020 19:26,This is the best music app no doubt but it keeps saying all my songs need SoundCloud go even though it doesnt say that on other peoples account ive deleted the app and got it back and it did nothing
2126,Filter,4,8/14/2020 11:51,I wish it was just quality music not just anyone making noises. The available trash is hard to filter through. Takes a lot of time.
2127,Love this app,5,7/28/2020 9:40,"It’s so easy to download music and listen it takes very little data
One complaint is I can’t listen to every song for free"
2128,Love listening to the music on SoundCloud!,5,7/28/2020 1:21,"My so is doing more & more with sound design & I’m thrilled to be able to listen to every song of his & so much more, with SoundCloud!☺️"
2129,Noice,5,7/27/2020 13:10,"Great for underground/new artists, ive been using for about 3 years now. Itd be great if u could edit the order of your liked songs instead of only playlists"
2130,Good but glitched out,3,7/27/2020 21:57,"The app itself is fine but it’s glitches out so that when I try and like a song to save it, it just unlikes itself. I prefer not making playlists and the fact it does this really irritates me."
2131,Really Good App I definitely Recommend this app,5,7/5/2020 19:50,I recommend Sound cloud it’s a really good app for publishing your own music or just listing to music in general don’t hesitate to download this.
2132,Great app,5,6/30/2020 14:40,"Great app for listening on the go and anywhere 
definitely has the most song choices and latest music"
2133,Easy and good,5,4/8/2020 7:28,Good and really easy app to post on because i post only on soundcloud so far becase its cheap easy and pretty useful first song of mine is 1k+ second song 200+
2134,Love the app but,1,6/13/2020 16:19,Lately this app has been trash i pay yall money every month and for the past 3 days i cant even get it to load on my phone i cant access my playlist without a force close ive tried updates ive tried unistalling it. Super disappointing considering again you guys take peoples money for something they can only use sometimes 🙄 figure it out
2135,Not the best but really good,4,5/7/2020 0:30,I really like this platform. It's nice i can easily find versions of a song that are usually hard to find. And listening to my friend's favorite song who has same taste in music like me is nice.
2136,Can u fix the liking system plz?,5,3/24/2020 21:34,Everytime I like a song it go into my playlist and it unlikes every second after I like it
2137,Opinion,4,2/28/2020 22:42,It is awesome and all I really like it but you should make it to where we don’t have to pay  for downloading music because it would get you more customers just saying 👍😁
2138,Sound cloud,5,2/6/2020 15:37,There are no ads and I love that ! You can skip as much as you want! And you can listen to an endless playlist:) it’s worth downloading.
2139,You know what you’re getting,5,1/23/2020 3:43,This app made so many artist get discovered because of it’s ease of access and wide range of music. Love it. Soundcloud isn’t dead
2140,Hate the ads. Subscription too expensive,3,2/2/2020 16:15,"SoundCloud was always great. Now ruined by stupid ads. Drastically makes me much less likely to open the app now. Also to go from free app, suddenly to a $12-13 app is too great a jump. $3-5 price range might be acceptable for a previously free app."
2141,Better app,5,1/7/2020 4:47,I would rather u too get this app because it gives u a lot of music to listen to and u can listen to your music and it is the best app u can get 👍🏼👍🏼
2142,These Stupid Smoking Ads,4,1/7/2020 15:10,This app is fire but whats not fire is these annoying smoking ads I want to listen to music not bone drills and all those other things that be in here at least put regular useful ads in here
2143,Sound cloud,4,7/20/2022 21:05,I’ve been a avid user of this app for over 2 years and I really love how this app functions I would like a equalizer to play with but I can’t live without
2144,New update is horrible,2,6/29/2022 16:33,"I’ve been using the SoundCloud app for years now, and had no problem with it up until the new update. The new UI is laggy, glitchy, and isn’t in anyway a better layout. Go back to the old UI please. So many unnecessary changes."
2145,So far so good,5,6/12/2022 22:33,Only problem is the limitation in interacting more with other artist.. it just feels like there should be more tools
2146,Behind track,3,6/16/2022 21:57,After many years you guys finally add the “ behind track feature” and it STILL doesn’t show when the track was published. Come on!
2147,Idk,5,5/27/2022 5:15,It’s cool in some ways but the “recorded” music and the advertising after every 1 or 2 songs are ridiculous
2148,Love it!,5,2/13/2022 23:01,"Better than the pay music apps. I can always find what I want to hear anytime, every time !"
2149,So much potential.,4,5/18/2022 3:30,One of my favorite music apps! The only thing that would make this better is if it was more like a social media.
2150,"Great app, just stopped working",1,4/22/2022 12:28,"Great app previously, but stopped working even after update. Says “Network error, try again” for almost over a month now, tried everything to fix it but nothing works, seems like the app has a serious issue, hope the developers work on it."
2151,Playlist ads?,3,3/3/2022 18:32,They’ve added advertising for playlists they’ve made that pop up during a song. Pretty annoying to accidentally tap.
2152,Who doesn’t love SoundCloud,5,2/7/2022 10:18,I mainly use sound cloud for old x songs but sound cloud really has everything
2153,SoundCloud,5,2/4/2022 11:58,SoundCloud is a good app to play music and anything you want  I’m a church person so I listen to church music and not rap but I really enjoy having this app 👍🏾
2154,😍😍😍😍,5,1/15/2022 1:28,Love this app only wish more songs were available for search
2155,Discovering masters,5,11/22/2021 12:22,I found my flamenco guitar building teacher’s account on SoundCloud. I’m so excited to hear this magnificent artist and his collaboration with others. Terrific gems!
2156,Issue with the app,4,12/9/2021 7:57,"Hi, hope you can explain it to me. For some reason I can't check my listening history, it's been an issue for a long time"
2157,Soundcloud,5,11/4/2021 14:11,Literally an app I use every waking moment runs so smooth and links me to all my favorite artists
2158,It’s cool but,3,11/18/2021 8:08,"Even with the annoying ads, it’s a nice app. But why is it so difficult to check an artists profile? When I’m listening to a song, wither I press the artist name or press “go to artist profile” it doesn’t work???"
2159,Great music platform for smaller artists to get their name out there!!!,5,10/29/2021 17:59,I love being able to find and hear lesser known artists!
2160,Lil Fashion.,5,10/22/2021 4:11,"I found the artist Lil Fashion through your app. I really appreciate you guys designing an app for such a futuristic time, and era. Soundcloud seems to be the only app the has the hidden talent. 5-Stars!!!!!!"
2161,SoundCloud,5,9/3/2021 18:41,Wish u didn’t have to pay for pro for some songs tho.
2162,What??,1,9/24/2021 21:20,"What is going on?? SoundCloud was just fine until today. I tried searching up ""Rainbows and Stuff"" -ICP and when I tried clicking a song, it just advertised SoundCloud plus. I thought the app just needed to refresh, so I deleted it to download it again. I clicked the button several times but it wont download."
2163,It have the bast songs and you can find the song you what to here,5,8/19/2021 3:00,Done
2164,Pretty good,4,7/30/2021 19:14,only good experiance except for the fact that i have like 400 songs and listen to the same 100 on shuffle even how do i make it go threw all the songs??
2165,Review :),5,5/7/2021 0:35,I love this app! Its amazing and it doesn’t show ads for me. It has a lot of songs I love and I use this app all the time! I totally recommend!
2166,Too Many Ads,4,7/25/2021 7:18,"Yall be playing too many ads just to be listening to a song, and yall also need to stop putting all these advertisements on my screen every time I open the app. THANK YOU😑
STOP PLAYING THESE DANG ADS BEFORE YOU GET SUED YEAH WE GET IT U NEED TO ADVERTISE BUT NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO A STUPID AD TO TO LISTEN TO MUSIC!!"
2167,Sharing needs to be fixed,2,7/24/2021 15:16,Still no setting to allow audio snippets to play on Instagram story? I’m kind of annoyed cause I’m paying for pro unlimited and there’s still no speaker icon next to my otions when I try to share and promote my own tracks
2168,Not uploading,3,7/15/2021 4:32,Most of my music I would upload no problem but today they would not upload it would say processing and never upload
2169,Very slow for no reason.,3,6/25/2021 21:44,I can even scroll thru my likes with the app just freezing up so many times especially playlists it’s very annoying when I’m trying to relax
2170,Why do u have to put drivers license song,3,6/6/2021 19:35,So I was putting songs right? Well I was going to put driver’s license and then I see u have to pay for one song?! Like bruh..why do we have to buy something for the real song
2171,I can’t re download,1,5/31/2021 22:29,I was just skipping my music until it started glitching and I opened and closed the app but when I opened it up again it refused to open so it did it again and again until I deleted it but when I try to re download it it can not download so I need help I search it up there’s nothing so help me
2172,log in issue all of a sudden,2,5/29/2021 2:30,"i used to love soundcloud, but for about a month now i cannot log in. i tried to make a new account, with about four different emails, through apple, through facebook, even emailed them with no answer. it either doesn’t respond, says there’s an error, or thinks i’m a robot for some reason. it’s really disappointing because i love soundcloud. all of a sudden it logged me out and haven’t been able to do anything about it. if anyone has any clue why, i’d also greatly appreciate it."
2173,🎉🤍,5,4/14/2021 2:19,"I love getting to know other new artists,can’t wait to work with people network and make this a successful yr🧡"
2174,There’s nothing on the Home Screen like what’s described,2,4/24/2021 20:49,"I’m just trying to find my own freakin page, my profile, my music. There’s no menu, no three dots, no nothing that I can use. Utterly useless for my current need, trying to share a pice of my music with someone. No thank you."
2175,A lot of history,5,1/30/2021 10:42,Great history made through this platform.
2176,Good but one thing,4,2/21/2021 18:25,It’s a pretty good app but then should have a option for chat on phone which should make the message process better
2177,I-,5,11/17/2020 17:34,"Please help, the “See more listening history “ button is glitched and it won’t open at all ;-;"
2178,App barely works,3,1/5/2021 0:07,"Every time I use SoundCloud, it either freezes up for a long time, glitches and selects something I didn’t press on or skips the song playing or the app crashes."
2179,My complaint,4,12/27/2020 3:15,It was great at first but week's after I downloaded it I didn't let me save the songs in my library which I don't know how to fix...
2180,I really enjoy this app,4,12/20/2020 4:38,"I record cheesy prog metal/jazz fusion in GarageBand on my phone and I wanted to have my music on a streaming service of some kind, it’s super easy to get my stuff from there to SoundCloud."
2181,It’s a great app,5,10/18/2020 5:32,It’s a great app but when I put on a song it skip to a whole different song that I don’t want to hear
2182,Buggy when scrolling,5,10/8/2020 16:50,It’s honestly hands down the best app buts really buggy when scrolling
2183,Reproductor media too big in my phone,5,9/20/2020 22:27,I need help making it smaller as it was before please
2184,Problem,3,9/17/2020 11:54,"I have bought the offline version of soundcloud but all of my downloaded songs still struggle to play off of wifi, Dont buy soundcloud go+, Not worth it, Good for at home use"
2185,Great way to listen to your friends songs,5,8/24/2020 17:11,If you have friends that are musical this is a great way to listen to their songs.
2186,Pausing problem,4,9/3/2020 17:43,"I’ve been using this app since 2019 and I really love the app, but whenever I try to go on different apps, it pauses randomly. I never had this problem until now. Please fix it!"
2187,Totally cool!,5,8/2/2020 19:06,I have been using this app for over a year and I absolutely love it. It’s features are pretty amazing. I would definitely recommend for any music lover.
2188,I like it.,5,7/10/2020 12:05,"I honestly been using this app about 3 years for my music. Let you know I’m a 8th grader. Idk about others opinions, but I think it’s a a good app just for my own needs."
2189,Awesome but missing some features,4,7/19/2020 1:32,I wish that this would have siri support so I can play my favorite songs and playlists through the push of a button
2190,"Good For Music, But Gets My Goat",4,7/11/2020 1:03,"I’ve been using SoundCloud for years now and its been great in helping me find new music to listen to for free! However, if I hear one more anti-smoking ad I’m going to lose my mind."
2191,"Love Jack Kornfield During this time, he has given has all so much inspiration",5,4/18/2020 17:38,"I wake up everyday doing his daily meditation
And it carries me through the day, filled with love and compassion"
2192,Well...,3,6/28/2020 19:02,"I’ve been using sound cloud for a while now...it was great bc I got an ad like every hour, but now I get one every song. It’s hard to vibe when you constantly get adds. I’m not paying to listen to music....YouTube is honestly better at this point"
2193,"Good app, not without bugs",4,6/15/2020 9:31,Sometimes I cannot play music even with good WiFi. It just says loading error. which is frustrating otherwise good music player.
2194,$$$,3,6/1/2020 2:00,Stop making us pay for everything that’s not gonna help your business right now. There are much better apps for the same price. We liked you because you were free and allowed us to be free and express ourselves on there.
2195,??,3,5/22/2020 20:43,So i used to just search the artist i wanted to listen to and listen to all of their most popular songs from the search list but now it stops after i click on that one song? Why did you guys get rid of that?
2196,App Crashes Multiple Times a Day,1,5/15/2020 20:31,"If I use the search function, load a musicians profile, load my profile, scroll through tracks in any of these locations at any point the app will crash within like 20 seconds of switching to another app. Pretty rediculous core functions like this still dont work it has been like this for months."
2197,Always an OG for finding new music,5,3/27/2020 12:38,Update UI regularly to make things more user friendly. Easy to use and always fun to stumble upon new artists and new tunes. A staple for my stack.
2198,Great... but tons of ads!,4,4/10/2020 16:30,This app is amazing! But... every time the song ends an ad comes up. And the ads are the same so it’s a bit annoying.. other than that I love this app!!! Keep up the good work! 😄
2199,Above average app with obvious flaws,4,4/5/2020 6:54,"I love this app and how you can still do a hefty chunk of things without paying though this app has a tendency to crash, it might be an issue with my phone but it’s only with this app."
2200,Best app,5,3/26/2020 22:21,Who ever created SoundCloud is the best I plugged my headphones in and even though I cleared the app out of my thing the second I plugged my headphones in my music played
2201,SoundCloud,5,3/16/2020 19:13,TI IS THE BEST IT LET ME listen music and most of song on Pandora has way to many ads it is so annoying and  last time I had it wanted me to buy to listen to music  😂😂😂😂😂
2202,Every new update has a problem,3,3/26/2020 19:03,"Every time an update happens, a new glitch or bug appears. It’s insane. This time around I’m experiencing more crashes than I used to. The ads are fine. They aren’t appearing often as they used to, so that’s a plus."
2203,To the people that made this app,5,2/8/2020 21:25,Thank u so much for making this app it is the best because it has a lot of music that I like
2204,It’s ok,2,2/13/2020 3:09,"It’s is ok for a few songs to play, if you plan to make a playlist I would not download because after a few songs there are adds that are not skip able. Just like every other app there’s adds lots of them. Feel like there’s better option out there."
2205,It’s the best,5,2/7/2020 12:46,It just the best and I would never delete I could be in my car singing rapping has the best music ready for me to listen to so y’all should get it
2206,Great app,5,1/24/2020 23:37,"Just wish we could upload directly from the app. Other than that, SoundCloud works wonderfully on my phone."
2207,SEE THIS‼️,5,1/4/2020 17:46,Hey For creators it’s Actually been like this for aWhile now.. but SoundCloud shows you following one extra person that you Really are for some reason?
2208,Great music player,5,8/2/2022 0:11,From time I started using SoundCloud I new it  would be that music app I been wanting
2209,What the heck SoundCloud,1,9/2/2022 1:12,So I have been a musician for over 10 years and posted a lot of my music for a while on here. I just logged in to find all my songs deleted and a lot of my favorites songs gone from the app. What is going on. This is the first time this has ever happened and I am very disappointed.
2210,Soundcloud is best,5,7/27/2022 22:50,Probably the best music app for unreleased or underground artist it is easy to use and i’d recommend to any of my friends it is 10/10
2211,Good but many bugs,3,7/29/2022 23:45,"The new style looks a works very well, only problem is if you close, turn off your phone (still plays music) will close with no reason"
2212,The best music ever try it,5,5/21/2022 22:27,The best music ever try it and then you like it all kind of music you want en Español Columbia watch about Bamba the total for the Canciones some Música cumbia Sonidera rock Rap reggaeton norteña canciones de todo tipo de gustos y géneros música para todas las edades es que no le gusta la aplicaciones
2213,new update totally breaks app,2,6/13/2022 14:34,the latest update for the app with the UI redesign totally breaks the app. Don’t exactly know why you would release an updated UI for a music app when the update also makes it impossible to listen to music. Seems like a small oversight to me.
2214,SoundCloud,5,4/27/2022 23:13,It is a great app to listen music on. Great quality and easy to use even if you don’t use technology a lot.😎😎
2215,I prefer SoundCloud,5,3/28/2022 1:28,Can u give us a way to organize our playlists we create
2216,SoundCloud,5,3/9/2022 0:02,This is an amazing app because it's free and no pay or anything and I can listen to any song a want.
2217,Great app,5,3/1/2022 6:39,Has ads after listening to many songs in a row
2218,Have always loved SoundCloud.,5,2/25/2022 5:55,SoundCloud has been a source of new music and artists for a long time. I love you. all of you.
2219,A lot of niche music,5,1/23/2022 4:31,Can find a lot of things here that you can’t find on other apps.
2220,Liked Tracks deleting,3,2/24/2022 21:08,This app has been great until recently when I lost all of my liked tracks for some reason. Hope this is fixed soon..
2221,Please please there are to many ads,4,2/1/2022 13:10,Please please there are to many ads way to many fix this problem otherwise the app is awesome
2222,Cool loking app,5,8/26/2021 10:20,Great music app for those who want to listen new and up coming talent and music you can’t find anywhere else.
2223,SoundCloud plus,4,12/28/2021 17:41,"I love this app but personally my only concern is, I am paying for the plus and I can’t listen to music offline and that’s honestly what I am buying plus for."
2224,Love it!,5,6/2/2021 0:41,I was able to find songs on SoundCloud that I couldn’t find anywhere else. 🥰🥰
2225,Pretty good👍,4,7/2/2021 20:39,Not a bad app all around but I do have. A problem with the add unless you pay to get rid of them but I do. Love the app but all I would change is no ads for anyone.
2226,Beautiful app works great I like that you can pick what song you want to listen to,5,5/30/2021 8:14,10-Oct
2227,Great Music App,5,5/23/2021 15:02,I like SoundCloud for the variety of music they have and I can listen to my music without a subscription
2228,Enjoy the app,5,4/30/2021 17:57,Really do enjoy using the app to see other artist music but also share mine too !
2229,Love it,5,4/25/2021 4:36,Omg I love it so much this app has inspired me to drop out of high school and become a professional SoundCloud rapper and I now have 113 followers and I don’t regret it at all
2230,Extraordinary Music Forum,5,4/23/2021 3:41,This app really gives people the opportunity to quickly show their talents to the world — at lightning speed!
2231,Great app!,5,4/14/2021 21:22,"Such an easy platform to use, and has some great hits you can’t find anywhere else"
2232,Suggestion,5,3/29/2021 13:43,You should make messages and DM’s more streamlined and available on the app as a way to help creators engage more with their fans
2233,Has everything I need,5,3/22/2021 14:21,"Small artists are what I like to listen to, this app is full of them"
2234,Just a thought.,5,3/15/2021 4:50,I love the app but I would be more cooler if we could upload music from our iPhone’s to SoundCloud.
2235,Why I give it a 3 star,3,3/17/2021 21:33,I’ve been using SoundCloud since 2017 and it’s 2021 so about 4 years now but and it’s been great it’s just one problem. It is laggy !! I don’t know if they need to update their app or what not but it’s wayyyy to glitchy
2236,This app is amazing,5,3/14/2021 16:01,It’s free music I just love the app and If u don’t wanna download it u can use it on Safari or Google. I definitely will recommend this app🥳🥳
2237,Love It,5,3/8/2021 19:18,"As both a lover of music as well as being a musician with a SoundCloud page, I’ve found the app to be excellent."
2238,Appreciated,5,2/25/2021 1:44,The fact that there is a platform for anyone to display their art is something be thankful for. Much appreciated!
2239,Best for Sharing Sou d,5,1/19/2021 18:02,"Love this app for sharing sound files. Maybe one of the best if not the best for doing so. I don’t have a pro account yet, but I’m considering it."
2240,Pls fix this!,3,1/28/2021 3:03,Sound cloud I really love ur app but when I publish my first song I would get I follower from inappropriate followers pls fix it so I can upload for music not because it’s stoping me it’s because I’m scared I’ll get more of those followers
2241,WOW,5,1/8/2021 6:41,Its great than my last one because i couldn't find good songs and the good songs were deleted!
2242,Good music choices,5,12/15/2020 3:35,Have everything song your looking for
2243,It’s good,4,12/20/2020 6:06,I like the app and it’s great I just don’t listen to it that much because I have Apple Music but this would be great for someone who wants like free music besides other music things
2244,Hot shot,5,11/6/2020 20:34,I love playing it but it strays too far from similar tracks. I need the same artist or ones with features.
2245,No Private Profile setting????????,1,12/3/2020 20:26,"Okay, so I just made my account and yet I somehow got a follower from a weird bot. Like a phishing bot. And uh... how come you couldn’t fix your failures now? We got bots following other people and yet you can’t make a feature called private your account? Disappointed, 5 stars will come back AFTER you add the feature."
2246,Awesome App,5,10/31/2020 4:04,In The Top 5 Apps SoundCloud is definitely one of them not sure of the order but at least it’s no lower than 5.
2247,Very good,5,8/5/2020 22:36,I use this app to find the rare music I listen to and I usually find it I would highly recommend downloading this and making a free acount
2248,The old soundcloud,3,10/16/2020 0:45,I used & still use soundcloud to this day & it never fails.. but i could really go without an add every 2 songs i play. I miss when soundcloud was free but i guess bankruptcy really changes things.
2249,Notification button shows up randomly,3,9/18/2020 20:31,"I wanna see the notifications I get but I have to wait for the app to decide if its going to show me the notification button, it isn't consistent"
2250,Terrible updates for analytics!,1,8/20/2020 4:37,"As a podcast creator, the change from analytics on the Pulse app to the SoundCloud seem to mean well by having things all in one place.  However, the titles and amount of listens run off the screen and you can’t see your numbers. Something within the last two updates to this app went wonky, please fix this!!!!!"
2251,"Great, but something better👍🏻",5,7/30/2020 14:44,Why don’t you make all music free to listen to then let people purchase Go+ so you can get better ratings and great smiles
2252,Soundcloud,5,7/19/2020 18:12,I love this app because I have iPhone so I could just down load this app and listen to my music for free without spending anything
2253,Needs some fixes.,3,7/20/2020 21:35,It’s a good streaming app but the amount of adds is terrible. And another issue is when I’m playing music and it plays “related tracks” instead of just playing tracks by the artist that I’m listening to.
2254,Mind blown,5,6/1/2020 21:05,I don’t have SoundCloud go+ but even with the adds I have a great time using it plus the music selection is unlike any other.
2255,Fix ur stuff,1,6/21/2020 4:26,It was all going great until all my songs that I already how to my playlist went premium and now I can’t listen to any songs because I have to pay monthly when I already listen to the songs. All the sudden every single song went into premium so I can’t even listen on a free app to free music I have to pay on a free app.
2256,Thank you sound cloud,5,4/21/2020 1:56,I understand the payment options lately but thank you for keeping my favorites free
2257,Crashes,4,5/11/2020 6:11,"The last update didn’t resolve 100% the crash issue. Still keeps crashing and disconnecting from my car, using Bluetooth. 
Car is Ford Explorer with Sync2 version."
2258,Love the app but more song playlists would be nice,5,3/21/2020 22:23,I have a playlist with 361 tracks and the limit is 500 but I can’t add on. Up the limit
2259,BumCloud,1,4/17/2020 14:42,"I’ve been a fan of SoundCloud for YEARS but y’all have officially RUINED the app. The ads are UNNECESSARY! If y’all want people to pay for a subscription cool, you can do that without inconveniencing others who don’t want to pay or who can’t pay. The adds are unreasonable as well sometimes it’s an add after every song sometimes it’s two adds back to back ugh, this app is officially TRASH!"
2260,Amazing,5,3/11/2020 9:21,I can listen to music while navigating other apps the sound quality is also premium.
2261,Good App Overall,4,3/20/2020 9:28,"This is a great app! Use it everyday to listen to music. The recommendations are on point, and the ads aren’t too much. Yes, they can be annoying when you’re playing sad songs and crying, but it’s tolerable lol."
2262,Great app but,3,3/18/2020 19:42,"It’s a great app but it glitches out so much, It barley lets me remove songs from my playlist. Then for some reason songs have been removed from my playlist even though I never removed them which is frustrating"
2263,songs go on Go+ randomly,4,3/13/2020 10:13,if this is a bug please fix this because songs will be free for about a couple days then go on Go+ for like a week and its very aggravating
2264,The good songs and barely any adds,5,3/6/2020 22:48,Their app is good barely any adds and lets you listen to your music.
2265,New Mobile Upload is AWESOME,5,2/25/2020 1:41,The new ability to upload directly from the app on a mobile device is a game changer! Thank ya’ll so much for adding that!!
2266,Good music for good people,5,2/20/2020 23:43,Soundcloud is unlike any other music platform souly because users are allowed to upload their own music unlike rich celebrities.
2267,Browsing and sound quality,5,1/21/2020 22:33,"Amazing love the sound quality and I am able to browse throw different song it’s amazing.
😊"
2268,Everything besides the Advertising,5,1/10/2020 13:17,"Without the advertisements, this app is flawless. If I counted the advertisements, my rating would be much lower."
2269,New update,5,9/7/2022 11:25,"Thank god the old UI is back, though I do admit it’s a bit overwhelming just how much shows on my screen 😞❤️"
2270,The app,5,8/17/2022 17:20,It’s an amazing app they’ve definitely updated it since the last time I used it
2271,New update,5,6/13/2022 13:40,I’m my opinion this new update makes the platform way better .
2272,SoundCloud fan,3,7/28/2022 9:54,"Love SoundCloud. 
Just a couple of sugggestions.
-Please add a « delete from playlist » feature for individual songs.
-Fix bug where all of my playlists are not populating on the newest app version.
Thanks! 🙏"
2273,It just crashes,3,7/4/2022 4:52,Crashes while playing music. It’ll play 1 second then stop. I tried troubleshooting but it doesnt work. I restarted my phone and its data. Just like fix it bro.
2274,Uploading Songs.,4,6/17/2022 14:41,It’s Cool.. been using this app since 2014 and never had a problem with it. now all of a sudden i can’t upload songs…
2275,👍,5,5/31/2022 5:03,This app is so good especially if you don’t have wifi you can still use it it’s a life saver!!
2276,Great,5,5/11/2022 23:31,"I love the fact that you can find released songs, stuff that is unreleased, and cool mashups all in one place which is super cool and convenient"
2277,Enjoy,5,3/22/2022 0:11,Good place to find songs you can’t find anywhere else.
2278,Bring messaging to soundcloud mobile!!!,2,4/30/2022 14:52,It’s crazy to think that an app this scale doesn’t support messaging on their mobile platform. It’s terrible to have to open a desktop to view messages. Would love this feature asap!!
2279,The ad traps are infuriating,1,4/16/2022 15:30,"The way SoundCloud started doing ads and trapping you to look at them is actively the reason I stopped using the app. No one likes to be treated like that, it feels disrespectful to my time. I’d use it way more and collectively listen to way more ads if the structure allowed it to play in background. Also queues would be great."
2280,Great App Website is better,4,1/25/2022 2:00,Like any app the web version is better for computer just because of the bigger screen.
2281,Don’t like that the mobile website is newer looking than thr app,4,1/21/2022 20:06,Please update it so it looks newer..it looks ancient rn compared to mobile website
2282,Review of Soundcloud,5,12/12/2021 3:43,10 of 10 would definitely recommend :)
2283,Omg so good,5,11/3/2021 19:33,It’s so good because you can literally just play and do something else while you listen to music
2284,Great,5,8/30/2021 20:55,PLEASE make the option to “search” at the top of a playlist like you can with your likes
2285,Great content,5,8/11/2021 5:53,Always find something creative to hear
2286,Abuses iOS notification system,1,8/30/2021 16:37,"Like a child wanting attention, this app will spam the Notification Center if you don’t use it as frequently as they would like. Apps that do this automatically get 1 star, and then get deleted from my phone. I guess I’m stuck using their mobile website."
2287,Feels good to find an app that’s for the people,5,8/10/2021 2:12,Feels good to find an app that cares about its users and provides a free platform to enjoy artwork. Thank you.
2288,Error,5,8/7/2021 17:23,It won’t let me add more songs and it keeps on taking of my songs
2289,Amazing ✨,5,7/4/2021 21:51,Amazing for uploading my own music. and listening to music. Pretty good layout. Should add some more cool accessibility features though.
2290,SoundCloud you da best,5,5/10/2021 2:32,"The new algorithms y’all got now for shufflin my likes is amazing. It be goin deep sometimes 
Like tracks I haven’t thought about in years"
2291,Definitely fw it,4,5/30/2021 4:04,I 24/7 be listening to music but we need playlists to not have a limit and we need a lyrics button💯
2292,GREAT music app,2,5/24/2021 12:42,"Love love love this app! Sooo many remixes from awesome musicians and producers. So easy to upload your own music. 
2 stars because the app keeps crashing..:about every 3-5 songs, which without soundcloud pro, means I have to listen to double the amount of ads due to the app CONSTANTLY crashing."
2293,An amazing app,5,4/30/2021 16:57,"I love this app when I am introduced to local music, they usually have a SoundCloud so I can listen to there early music."
2294,Best place for music,5,4/27/2021 22:16,Easy to use and long time user of SoundCloud . It’s lead me to find numerous new artists time after time .
2295,I would highly recommend SoundCloud😃,5,4/10/2021 17:38,Because when ever I need to potty I just slip in my earbuds🎧 and listen to “R0D WAVE” 🌊 while eating the four piece chicken nugget I got from Mc Donald’s.
2296,What happened?,4,4/18/2021 22:43,"I updated the app, and now when I go to the downloads list, my playlists for that section don’t show up. What’s up with that?"
2297,Sound Cloud,5,3/3/2021 23:30,You can homemade customize your music listening experience
2298,Wont let me edit my playlist,4,3/28/2021 1:20,Would of gave it 5 stars I been using SoundCloud for like 8 years but now it won’t let me edit my playlist
2299,Pls put repeat playlist,4,3/14/2021 6:53,I would sleep to my playlist but it goes to other song i dont want so please put a playlist replay on phone
2300,It is very hard to grow on this app,3,3/12/2021 15:26,This app is very hard to grow on al it is  is hard work and ads even with ads there’s so many good songs out there that we don’t know of think about that
2301,a great app for new artists.,4,3/3/2021 13:32,Although i wish there was a better way to share your music and get in touch with other artists to collaborate.
2302,Tumbled into this,5,2/3/2021 7:46,"This is just what I need another app with free music for awhile, honestly when the trial is over I’m committed. I enjoy not having sold comd"
2303,It won’t let me sign in it keeps saying,1,2/6/2021 20:24,Ok so basically I put in all my information and I Sign In with Apple and it keeps saying that “you believe I am a spam” so I cannot sign in. What the heck is up with that?! I just wanna sign in listen to music follow my friends who produce music and you guys won’t even let me sign in. PLEASE fix this problem.
2304,Next Level For Independent Musicians,5,1/30/2021 1:03,This is THE way fir independent musicians to share their music without giving up control to the super greedy industry!
2305,SoundCloud,4,2/2/2021 13:12,They barely have adds and it’s really good and when u click a song they play it and not the playlist
2306,Incredible musical network,5,12/20/2020 19:25,"Hands down the most giving network, with the best format for exposure!"
2307,Soundcloud keeps crashing,3,1/27/2021 21:03,"Since this morning, my music would randomly cut off for no reason. This is the fourth time has happened today, you guys need to fix this."
2308,Good overall,4,1/9/2021 21:36,There is ads which is ok but also there aren’t some songs on this app and it’s hard for o try to look for them
2309,Use every day,5,12/15/2020 4:12,Great app and works without Wifi if already played before!
2310,Highly recommended,5,10/30/2020 16:35,You can any song you want in this soundcloud.
2311,Nice love it,5,8/17/2020 22:20,Love it very much listen to it all the time can’t leave home without listening to my music and on the highway as I’m driving down the road
2312,Love it BUT,4,8/29/2020 3:13,"please answer me, Why it takes so much to uploading our own audios? It takes like 2 days and they aren't even that long (20 second) and it takes 2 days, why??!"
2313,Love this app,5,8/12/2020 19:33,"I love using this app, but I truly hates the advertisement after each songs. I just hope there weren’t any. Other than that great app to use."
2314,Amazing,5,6/9/2020 17:32,Needs better music selecting. You have to know the song even if it’s unreleased and not many people know about it
2315,"great, but something useful was removed",4,7/8/2020 8:52,"I love this app, even though the option to not get a station based on a playlist is now gone, which I don’t understand"
2316,Like system is broken,3,6/21/2020 10:26,"So I was just trying to like songs and all of a sudden it unlikes itself ,the only way to keep a song liked is if I like it and unlike it 100 times, this annoying bug needs to be fixed ASAP"
2317,Review,5,5/30/2020 23:00,I like it because you get to listen to any song it’s a cool app for my black peoples to turn up like chicken and watermelone so yea we get lit to this app and I like the categories shout out to the protest
2318,SoundCloud,5,5/16/2020 21:03,I love it because you can save songs and it doesn’t give you a limit I  Iike this app better than pandora
2319,Good but not unlimited,5,5/7/2020 8:53,It’s cool you get to listen to whatever song you want but has a limit but still cool
2320,Random trials,3,5/14/2020 14:14,"I love SoundCloud I’ve been using it for the past 3 years with no problems. But, all of a sudden I have random monthly trials which stop allowing me to listen to my songs regardless of if they we’re SoundCloud go+ or not and I’ve never had go or go+."
2321,Not trying to be rude but...this app is so bad,1,5/11/2020 6:31,It will srs say not available after like a few hours days when you liked a song and sometimes it doesn’t even work i was trying to listen to a song but it would just stay at the first part please fix well  i don’t expect anything good from a free app but it was better at first
2322,This app is great,5,2/2/2020 22:17,This is great for if you wanna hear music without looking at the video I would definitely would recommend this app
2323,Trouble uploading,4,5/2/2020 14:44,"Every time I try to upload something it says “preparing to upload”, and it just takes forever! Can you please fix this?"
2324,Mike,4,4/30/2020 17:27,"I like the software and settings environment of the application.
Quality is good and navigating is easy.
I like it overall. I can not download any program and that is not easy some times.
But overall good."
2325,Ads are fine....but this kind are awful,1,4/29/2020 4:05,SoundCloud should have a option to choose different ads for people that it would fit. I don’t like hearing super loud drills and awful sounding ads everytime. I don’t vape or do dip there should be a option to skip those ads. They hurt my ears and I’m seriously going to switch to other music providers if they don’t fix it
2326,Sort by,4,2/22/2020 2:00,Can you guys please add a sort by button so we can edit playlists i dont wanna have to move every single song a sort by button is easier
2327,SoundCloud,5,1/24/2020 1:11,It’s amazing and it’s good to listen to other people’s songs that aren’t signed and other rappers who aren’t signed but have talent they are listened to on here so it’s great to have this app
2328,I love it,5,1/3/2020 14:38,"This app is the best, the only thing I don’t really like is the ads, I get that they need it to make money but some of them are just annoying"
2329,Made my day,5,1/2/2020 21:30,This app made my day instead of paying I get to listen to music without being on the app thanks to sound cloud
2330,Great for uploading,5,1/2/2020 2:38,I upload on this as my main i have a few followers to it is great that so many people like my music.
2331,It has everything,5,8/31/2022 14:26,If u have a sound in mind SoundCloud has it
2332,Good Job Guys,5,8/15/2022 14:51,I love the amount of songs and audios on this platform. These are great for animating and creating videos that go along with popular trends on the internet.
2333,sound cloud memberships,3,8/30/2022 2:30,i search up a song and it take me to buy Soundcloud Go this is annoying and it never did that till this latest update
2334,Likes Updates GONE,3,8/28/2022 13:51,I used to get notifications on who liked my tracks. Now the notifications section ONLY gives you updates on who follows you. What a joke this update is.
2335,Free uploads,5,7/30/2022 13:53,It’s awesome how SoundCloud allows the artist to upload a certain amount of free space it helps to get exposure out there. Five stars thank you SoundCloud!
2336,This is a really good app I love it,5,7/28/2022 23:58,I can listen to all the songs I would like I would really recommend this app.
2337,Best,5,7/12/2022 0:47,I can go down a rabbit hole of song after song on SoundCloud. If you like mixing this is the app for you.
2338,One of the best music apps ever,5,5/28/2022 0:11,It has all my favorite music artists and I can also post my own music on it. It’s a great app.
2339,Very good,4,7/3/2022 0:30,Very good app but the only problem is that some of my favorite songs are not available in my country which makes me rate the app 9/10
2340,New update is awful,4,6/15/2022 18:11,Change it back to how the og version of the layout for liked songs looked. Theyre too big now
2341,Great app!,5,5/24/2022 15:53,But you should be able to delete comments
2342,SoundCloud app,4,5/13/2022 23:11,Doing things around it have nothing to do with the program because is not there business what’s am doing.

2346,Great platform.,5,4/28/2022 2:24,Sound some underground songs I thought were lost forever.
2347,It need to work,5,4/24/2022 23:55,Good but it needs to work when there is no wife when you use it
2348,App,5,4/12/2022 17:00,Better user friendly for djay so they have access to music
2349,review,5,4/1/2022 15:41,SoundCloud is a great app! You can have as much playlist as you want and you can even post your oen music.
2350,Very good,5,3/4/2022 22:28,I get to listen to unreleased songs from all my favorite artists. It’s also nice to hear non-popular artists.
2351,Get it,5,2/27/2022 16:19,I love it i sign in with google and it can also recommend songs you like so get it
2352,The best,5,2/5/2022 21:34,"This is the best music app I have ever used
An u can play songs on your playlist out side on your phone 🙂"
2353,Playlist organization,3,2/23/2022 13:09,Dear SoundCloud developers I am having technical difficulties trying to organize my songs and music every time I try to add a song or music to my favorites it just reverts back please dix this.
2354,Ad,5,1/13/2022 17:29,Too many ads pops out.. it would be perfect when u stop ads
2355,Soundcloud= 🔥🔥,5,12/17/2021 2:05,soundcloud is a good app and especially if you like knowing when you can skip ads
2356,What a app,5,11/1/2021 0:26,The amount of quality music and cool features this app has is amazing!!  Highly recommend!
2357,Repost by SoundCloud,4,11/28/2021 22:07,I love SoundCloud I use it everyday from listening to music to releasing my own… would love an app for repost by SoundCloud so I can manage distribution on the go easier.
2358,The only bad part is the ads,5,6/28/2021 20:21,And you need tkk on pay for some songs
2359,Awesome app except one thing,4,9/19/2021 15:26,"So I have been using SoundCloud for a while, and it’s a awesome app. But lately it keeps restarting while I’m on a different app. Otherwise it’s a really good app"
2360,Stepping stone,5,6/26/2021 14:22,"Been using soundcloud for years and years. The best app. They were the reason music got spread, very long time ago."
2361,Great but…,4,6/21/2021 21:59,"This app is the best but I’ve been seeing these comments with VERY inappropriate links and comments. 

I’ve also tried to do shuffle play on my playlists but it only plays a few songs then stops, I thought it’d randomly go through all of the songs, not just a few.

Thank you for reading this review and have a nice day 

                               😊
                               🙏🏽"
2362,GO +,3,5/31/2021 4:58,I understand that you need to make money but we have to pay to listen the the good songs and it doesn’t really matter cause somebody is going to repost the song and it will be free.
2363,Good app,5,4/29/2021 2:20,I like that it will still play when your phone is on iove Keep up the hard work!
2364,Love,5,3/29/2021 3:01,"This is the best music app hands down, you’ll discover a lot of new artists and songs with this app"
2365,Great but missing one thing.,4,4/16/2021 15:53,I do enjoy the app. It’s great to be able to share my music from my pocket. But why isn’t their a message feature yet?
2366,SoundCloud,4,4/3/2021 14:24,"The song in SoundCloud sometimes has  no sounds 
Also the SoundCloud is one of popular things now I want you to fix it"
2367,10/10 would recommend,5,2/15/2021 18:49,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP! Especially because I’m a kpop Stan I can listen to songs that are not official! It’s amazing I totally recommend this app!
2368,Aight,4,3/16/2021 18:52,Fix your app it’s been out for years yet still has problems every time I like a song it doesn’t go to my likes
2369,Ads are annoying,3,3/3/2021 14:41,"Annoying, annoying and annoying ads. I hate it when I wanna listen to a music and almost all the time I should listen to 20 seconds of ads!"
2370,Five stars but...,5,2/9/2021 16:26,This is amazing would recommend this to people that love lofi but ads are a little frequent thats it.
2371,This is epic,5,2/8/2021 7:16,The only reason I am giving this a five star review is because of the hit song tribal 2.0 by Jacob kimerer it is truly life changing
2372,Use it every day,5,1/20/2021 12:13,This app is great! I’m a big fan of lo-fi music and I can find Lo-fi music and more! I really recommend it if you like public music
2373,OMG BEST MUSIC AP EVER,5,11/22/2020 12:40,I love this app this app is perfect for when you want to listen to music or a certain song you don't have to pay for premium music
2374,No way to manage account,1,1/8/2021 14:26,"Can’t check the messages or do many other things that you need to do to manage your account. And if you try to sign into SoundCloud on iPhones internet, it refuses to let you and says you have to use the app to use sound cloud on mobile. Frustrating."
2375,Honestly this app is good,4,12/5/2020 3:53,It’s great bc u can stream most songs just wish premium wasn’t like it was and u could do every song but it’s fine
2376,Best Music Service,5,11/12/2020 6:00,"I’ve tried them all and Soundcloud is my favorite, lots of good underground music that’s not on the more corporate platforms."
2377,Best app ever,5,9/29/2020 16:53,"I like sound cloud been using it for years now 
Keep the good work sound cloud team
Thank you"
2378,Waste of time,1,11/3/2020 11:23,I'm a music composer and usually i upload my music which i create with a variety of music apps to this app ... But i will never accept that this app accusing me of breaking a copyright while these music made by me and i got the master music records only because it's looks like another music by 1% ... No way i accept an insult like this
2379,Great app,5,8/13/2020 19:53,Keeps playing even when the app is closed I used this during games with friends or even studying
2380,Promo spam & drug advertisement,3,8/15/2020 16:20,There’s way too much comment spam on songs where people are self promoting or even advertising drugs..! Also I can’t figure out a way to change the name of my playlist which means it’s lacking function.
2381,Amazing,5,8/9/2020 10:37,"It’s amazing for music, but currently and I not sure if it’s a bug, but for some odd reason my playlists are appearing twice. Overall an awesome app to use for music!!!😄🎧"
2382,Too Many Ads Now,1,7/19/2020 16:50,"Just like the title says, good luck listening to any music with this app tossing you an ad after every song. If your lucky you’ll get to listen to at least two before you get another. And the video ads? Can’t tab out of the ad and multitask. You have to watch the ad to continue listening.... thanks for that."
2383,Title,5,7/5/2020 4:04,SoundCloud is great because all the good trap metal and witch house starts there. My only issue is the 30sec long back to back unskippable ads but no bug deal i should just pay.
2384,Great app!,4,7/10/2020 11:42,The app is great itself but in recent updates more ads have been playing then before! Before you would get an ad every 20-25 songs and now it’s 1-2 songs.
2385,Best App Ever,5,5/29/2020 16:50,I haven’t any problems with this app what so ever. Hands down best app I’ve used for music and it even has music that isn’t on other apps. I really like this app.
2386,NO,2,6/30/2020 16:54,"i mean if you like listening to 2 minute ads before every song you listen to, then i guess it’s okay. it would be tolerable if it was 1 ad every 5-6 songs but now it’s after literally every song. and if you fall asleep listening to a song you’ll be ear raped by a stupid mcdonald’s breakfast ad"
2387,So good until their new update,1,6/19/2020 22:47,"It was such a great app to use, but then they made 80% of the songs I had on my playlist only playable if I purchased SoundCloud premium for $13 a month. Started using Musi which is just like the old version of SoundCloud, but I’ve still spent hours adding all my music to Musi so I’ll leave this last bad review before I delete SoundCloud"
2388,Love soundcloud hate the app!!,1,6/13/2020 22:54,"Soundcloud is awesome but their app is god awful. Always crashes and they need to add a lot of features.  Such as play next, easier ways to add a group of songs into a playlist. Very primitive app. And as of now I cant even open the app it just crashes everytime. Been using soundcloud for over 5 years and its starting to get pretty out dated"
2389,Amazing,5,5/7/2020 0:05,SoundCloud is an amazing way for me to make goals as an artist and provide the internet with my many sounds. Thanks for being so great! Keep up with the good music.
2390,Weird,3,5/10/2020 14:11,I have been using soundcloud for as long as i can rememeber and i dont know if this is a glitched but about 98% of my songs got added to soundcloud go in 1 day i go to soundcloud and they were all soundcloud go so i want to know if its glitched or just being weird.
2391,Nice for music i guess,5,4/14/2020 19:29,Theres a lot of playlist and gives newbie rappers a chance to grow a lot of people came from here and i enjoy it very much
2392,"Excellent, but there’s one thing remaining",3,4/24/2020 15:01,"I love SoundCloud, it’s one of my favorite music apps, but I’d love if you guys add a regular music player which doesn’t have a Quota and that’s private, the possibilities of having a music player in SoundCloud are massive, so I’d love if you guys could add one in the near future."
2393,SoundCloud Review.,5,4/7/2020 23:16,"This is an amazing app, everything that I search for, I immediately find. I highly recommend this app for music lovers like myself!"
2394,SoundCloud,5,3/17/2020 19:11,Hi my name is Ruben and I just wanted to say that SoundCloud is a really good app to use because you can fine songs that you can’t find on other music apps.

2398,Diversity,5,2/18/2020 15:12,"I’ve been listening to soundcloud for over ten years and it’s been the single best source for finding new, unique music in all genres."
2399,Almost every song in my library has become SoundCloud GO exclusive,1,1/12/2020 19:11,"I have almost 1400 songs in my liked library and now about 1100 of them are only available, a very bad and sudden change and I can only listen to some songs for their full length without paying. I used to love this app but I can’t even stand to use it now."
2400,Very good app for new creators,4,1/11/2020 20:52,"very clear music, great options, but I wish that they would make it easier to shuffle playlists and edit things in personal libraries. Otherwise great!"
2401,Sound cloud,5,6/20/2022 5:10,I love sound cloud but can you make it so that you can listen to music offline
2402,terrible update,2,8/23/2022 18:38,I like the app but after the new update half of my saved songs went missing which I guess is a glitch since I have an account and all of my songs are saved in a playlist
2403,Ads,4,6/29/2022 10:25,SoundClouds good but the ads bug me because they can’t be skipped and you have to go through 30 seconds of music you don’t like.
2404,Please Fix.,4,6/23/2022 3:15,Could you fix the playlist from  disappearing every time I try to add a new song to a playlist. Thank you.
2405,W update,5,6/8/2022 19:09,Oh nah SoundCloud realize they were in like 6 place and made a W update so far I haven’t look at it fully
2406,Unlike,3,6/17/2022 23:10,"Unable to unlike songs from playlist as they still appear but they move to the top of the playlist 
Please fix"
2407,Love it,5,3/1/2022 17:45,"Used it since I was 14 and have loved ever minute, I get to see how my music taste has evolved and I can always go back for nostalgia"

2412,My Fav Music,5,12/29/2021 17:47,I like soundcloud more than them all actually. Way better playlists
2413,SoundCloud,5,12/21/2021 22:20,It’s a really good app but I don’t like that if the playlist is over it goes to different songs
2414,Best music app ever!,5,12/21/2021 17:16,It has a my favorite songs here. They recommended songs that I love. And SoundCloud rappers are super hard and that’s why I love SoundCloud.

2422,Legit,5,3/17/2021 10:31,"App is legit, had no problems, easy to find songs and upload too!"
2423,SoundCloud,3,6/14/2021 4:55,Honestly is a good app for music but the bad thing is it has an ad after every song and if I have to pay to listen to music without ads I rather pay for Apple Music
2424,Fix this,3,4/5/2021 14:11,Alright I have been using this for 3 years. Was good for a while and I loved it. But since the ad stuff happened I can’t get passed 2 songs without an ad. So I usually turn my phone on airplane mode. F ads
2425,Unable to Edit Playlist,3,3/28/2021 4:39,It was great until I keep getting the error message check internet connection when I edit my playlist.
2426,No problems but...,4,3/23/2021 0:39,The recent update deleted songs off my playlist

2430,Very good but...,5,1/6/2021 22:17,This app is really good it’s just that I would like to close out SoundCloud while a ad is playing but it stops
2431,More friends,5,11/24/2020 13:18,Wish I had some connects so I could do more business but that’s a personal problem. Lol🎶

2436,great music,5,9/13/2020 6:35,i LOVE soundcloud but i hate the adds specially the tide adds are very annoying but other than that i love it 100%
2437,Pretty cool app,5,8/11/2020 16:56,It’s a pretty nice app you can skip unlimited times they have unreleased and slowed down songs and have a pretty big selection of music
2438,Ads??,5,7/22/2020 4:03,Cool app but why am I getting ads about a girl saying that I’m vaping when I’m not 😂 and I don’t even do drugs like what. I’d really like if I got different ads like anything but drugs.
2439,HELP,3,7/25/2020 0:30,"Why is all my music now considered previews and I need to pay to listen to 95% of my playlist? This happened over night, it was not like this the last time I was using sound cloud but now all of a sudden I can’t listen to my music??"
2440,Amazing,5,7/12/2020 4:38,I use SoundCloud for unreleased music and lesser known artists that aren’t on main streaming platforms and the design of the app is easy to navigate and clean. I recommend
2441,Why I have them 1 star rating,1,7/14/2020 0:16,I gave them 1 star because they changed almost every song on my playlist to go+ meaning I couldn't listen to the majority of those songs completely without buying sounded go+ Even though days previous to this one I could listen to all the songs on there. This app is a disgrace
2442,Reliable,5,5/13/2020 9:24,It has kept all my songs intact for years else I would’ve lost my own music
2443,Sound cloud,4,6/15/2020 14:04,I really like the app there’s just a few things that I wish they would change. I wish they would get rid of GO+ so you could listen to any music.
2444,Great app,5,5/6/2020 1:20,I think it’s a great app because have songs that most platforms don’t have and it’s also free

2446,Needs an Update,3,5/2/2020 20:24,Soundcloud constantly crashes after a song is over and sometimes crashes when I select a song from my playlist
2447,TOO MANY ADS,2,4/12/2020 14:29,I’ve had SoundCloud for years and since the last couple years the amount of ads has gotten insane. You play two songs that are a couple minutes long and are guaranteed an ad. I wish they didn’t screw up the app and left It the way it used to be.
2448,songs,5,4/1/2020 14:25,"I love the songs they have on here, I have apple music and half the songs i can’t find on there, i can find on here and i love it!!!"
2449,☹️,4,4/7/2020 15:19,There is a new update that kinda ruined Soundcloud every single song now requires Soundcloud plus and before u never had soundcloud plus but now i have to pay
2450,Review,5,3/26/2020 15:21,It is the best music app when I need it and it doesn’t need service for recent listings history which is what I use and like tracks

2454,SoundCloud Go problem,3,1/27/2020 23:01,Sometimes it’s gonna make all of your music go into SoundCloud and you have to buy SoundCloud go just to listen to it again or you can make another account but it gets really annoying

2509,best music app,5,6/29/2020 23:43,I feel soundcloud is the best music app. It has all the good music plus you can play music while doing other things.
2510,I should be in a commercial,5,6/9/2020 21:03,"I don’t live FOR music. But music makes my life so much easier. SoundCloud is one of my preferred apps when I’m tryna catch a vibe. 
-Listen responsibly 😎"
2511,Great music but poor service.,1,6/26/2020 13:17,I have had many problems with SoundCloud ranging from only being able to have 500 songs on a playlist to report system not even working. As well no notifications for songs at all even though I made sure it was on. App needs many improvements
2512,Long term changes,3,6/20/2020 17:58,"Ads have taken over this app. It never used to be the way it is now. The app itself runs smoothly and I rarely have a problem. But it seems as if over time, I’m being flooded with ads."
2513,too many advertisements,1,6/20/2020 3:24,"Long advertisements - two of the 30 seconds ads for every couple of songs you switch. So if you’re trying to go through a playlist you have you might end up listening to ads more than you listening to songs. Don’t walk away, run from this app !"
2514,Go+,3,6/19/2020 5:30,I don’t know if this is a glitch or not but i had songs in my playlist that i could listen to and were not go+ but all of a sudden all of the songs in my playlist we go+ and i couldn’t use it anymore
2515,My songs are gone,1,6/11/2020 11:47,I added a song to one of my playlists yesterday and for some reason that was the only one that would show up. I deleted the song but that one stayed and deleted the rest of my songs. That was one of my favorite playlists. Please fix this problem and return my songs if you can.
2516,Barely any adds,5,5/28/2020 22:07,"I love this app because there are barely any adds, and you can play almost every song ever!"
2517,Tokyo cat :3,5,4/28/2020 19:09,Hi I’m the YouTuber Tokyo cat :3 I enjoy the app and listen to a ton of music on the app and you can search up songs my favorite is roses :3 I recommend buying this app it’s a great app :D!
2518,Lost ALL MY MUSIC,1,5/24/2020 0:55,I’m super upset. I’ve had SoundCloud for a very long time and have gathered so many songs on my playlist throughout the years. I just recently got a new phone and because I don’t have my Facebook anymore that I used to log in on my soundcloud I’ve LOST ALL LT MUSIC. Please if there is anyway you can help me log back into my old profile I would appreciate it so much!
2519,Why does it keep doing this,1,5/11/2020 22:16,I have had SoundCloud for a while it was good for awhile if I looked for a song I would pray it was not in the SoundCloud membership well I had my own playlist and I thought nothing would happen SoundCloud made all of my favorite singers for the membership ir is so annoying 😡 they all have only a sample it get really annoying
2520,S,5,4/23/2020 14:29,I like SoundCloud because is has great music however it does have lots of ads
2521,Love this app,5,4/15/2020 15:30,"Never freezes, sound quality is always clear"
2522,😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1,4/23/2020 13:56,I have had this app for a little while and every one in a while it does this but I have had enough and I’m fed up with it. One day my music is there the next it’s all gone or I have to pay for it and that’s not fair to me. So I will file a report on SoundCloud again cause this is ridiculous. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
2523,Soundcloud Go!?!,1,4/18/2020 4:10,"Why am I getting pop ups on my iOS sound cloud while I'm playing music after I already pay $4.99 a month for whatever premium service I have?? This pisses me off. Also, there is no way to close it or minimize the ad. This is a slap on the face to paying customers. The ad is for SoundCloud Go. 
Goes away or UnSubbed.  One month"
2524,It’s great!,5,4/5/2020 20:55,"I love the app! If there’s songs that aren’t on Apple Music, they’re on SoundCloud! It’s perfect! I make videos so I listen to songs and make ideas for the video! Thanks!!"
2525,App constantly crashes,2,4/7/2020 4:07,SoundCloud itself is great but the app constantly crashes or glitches out. It’s very buggy and it seems to never get better after updates. If anything it’s gotten worse. Would use the app more if it actually worked.
2526,To sound cloud,5,3/27/2020 12:47,I love this app for listening to music while playing video games that’s why I would give this a 5 star rate
2527,I really love this app,5,1/22/2020 3:07,I love the app and I have found everything I need for the past months. Please show this app some love and download it would really help.😎
2528,Deleted all my offline songs when skiing,1,3/15/2020 14:42,"I've been a SoundCloud Go+ customer for years, and the app suddenly decided to delete all my offline playlists for no reason. This was particularly awful because it happened while skiing. Literally the only reason I pay for SoundCloud is for offline access, so what gives?"
2529,Good but...,4,2/7/2020 4:36,SoundCloud is amazing it has almost every song but on iOS for some tease you can’t put your play list on repeat I would love if that was fixed otherwise it’s great
2530,"Too many ads, no good free songs",1,1/31/2020 15:36,"I’ve had SoundCloud for 3 years
There’s too many ads but you can skip them discreetly, but all of the songs you’ll get the app to listen to you’ll have to pay for, and with the free version sometimes 98% of your playlist(free songs) can turn into only SoundCloud go+ and you can’t do anything about it"
2531,SoundCloud review,5,8/17/2022 16:55,This is one of the best sound hubs for all artist more importantly the up and coming artist!!! It’s a great community of for these collective minds to create and be hear.

2537,DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE LIKE TRACKS,3,6/10/2022 22:36,"Good app but yall need to add a option where u can move your songs around in the ""liked tracks"". Once you unlike a song by accident, u cant put it where you want it to be. And that messes up peoples flows."
2538,My cancer won guys SoundCloud is the best music app I keep my self in music,5,4/16/2022 12:40,I keep my self in music so I be waiting in heaven for all you bye…

2547,ads,4,1/6/2022 23:41,the ads aren’t too much of a bother but would be way better if I had premium
2548,SoundCloud,4,11/24/2021 1:57,4 because it is a good service app and has great songs that sometimes can’t have on all music apps. But has ads.
2549,Good,5,8/31/2021 20:28,This is a good app to download for music or  to listen to podcasts 10/10 recommended you should download
2550,Not worth it anymore,1,10/4/2021 16:20,"The ada are incredibly annoying 
They’re long, many, and there’s not even an option to skip it after a certain amount of seconds
And there’s an ad after every single song

2583,Amazing,5,6/22/2020 14:22,This app helps you play music with your phone off   For free but I recommend buying there other version
2584,Awsome app!,5,4/25/2020 5:15,"As I am an, animator, YouTuber, and artist it’s boring to listen to dead silence! But with SoundCloud you can listen to all kinds of music! From; cavetown this is home, all the way to bloom and much more!"
2585,Review,2,6/18/2020 22:05,Sound cloud was my favorite app to use not have to have a plus version or whatever they are called. But now the playlist and all music I’ve been listening to is now a SoundCloud go+ song? That just made the app a no for me since I don’t have the money to pay for it.
2586,Really love soundcloud but it have been glitching a lot recently,4,6/10/2020 8:26,Soundcloud is a great app but recently it glitches almost every time i’m on the app scrolling through music. Please fix this.

2591,Fire🔥🔥,5,3/18/2020 18:24,Has good music every rapper I listen to and if you wanna sing you can upload your music here
2592,Best music app,5,2/25/2020 2:00,Use this app everyday has very good content for any type of music. Would definitely recommend.
2593,Freezing and skipping when first opening app,1,2/28/2020 17:49,Every time I go to my private playlist it freezes for no reason and it stops my music from playing I reset my phone many times I called a provider and nothing has worked so far this started happening yesterday.
2594,Great music app,3,2/25/2020 17:25,A good music app but they lowkey should make it so you can play on multiple devices  in your liked list because it tweak when me and my girlfriend are on our playlist  that’s the only real reason I can’t give it 5 stars .
2595,Easy to find episodes,5,2/18/2020 10:50,Talks about things that people need to see and understand.
2596,Profile Issues,3,2/14/2020 3:06,I love the app but every time I click on the profile or library icon the app crashes and it’s very annoying. If anyone has any suggestions to fix this it would be appreciated.

2599,Greedy developers,1,8/22/2022 2:15,The app has had the same problems and glitches for years that are never fixed. Ive used it for 10 years and now the developers send of barrage of advertisements and then want to charge you for searching songs. Awful
2600,Review,1,8/18/2022 19:39,"SoundCloud is getting worse and worse by the day. All I want to do is play music but I’m bombarded with ads, some being 30 seconds long, two in a row. Almost at the point I just want to delete the app completely, please do something this is getting ridiculous"
2601,Profile won’t load,2,7/10/2022 21:26,Whatever happened in his last update cause a pretty significant bug where I can no longer load my profile or anybody else’s profile page
2602,Amazing!🤩,5,6/7/2022 3:56,"SoundCloud makes it easy to upload my tracks, and has a lot of good recommendations, 5 stars!"
2603,What is going on,2,6/13/2022 14:12,I had this app since 2018 and then all of a sudden I can’t listen to half of the songs that I own in my playlist. Even with strong Internet it’s still refuses to work properly. So please fix this problem.
2604,Bugs,3,6/13/2022 13:47,Like the app it’s worked well until recently randomly today I can’t search music and some of the songs I have aren’t working
2605,Why,3,6/11/2022 21:51,I used soundcloud for 2 yrs with no issue but after the latest update i cant get through 1 song without it crashing 5 stars if fixed
2606,Great but glitch,4,6/11/2022 18:58,"Amazing app, love the new style, but any time I try to choose a specific song from my playlist it chooses the song above it. Plz fix!!"
2607,Must have app,5,2/11/2022 1:45,SoundCloud has always been a clutch app to find original and new material.
2608,Can’t log in into the same account,2,5/2/2022 1:28,"I can’t sign in the same account into my device. I have many device like ipad and samsung but they can’t sign in. 
I have to create another account and redownload same song again? 
No No No"
2609,We need a re play button,4,1/30/2022 5:29,Ok so sound cloud is great but we need a replay button not the ob song only the whole play list
2610,Oh,4,11/30/2021 7:54,I been listening to songs and the apps good but some of my songs are geting deleted maybe check it out
2611,Updated Version,2,12/26/2021 7:05,"This new updated version of SoundCloud doesn’t work well. Ever since updating the app freezes every single time I look up specific artists or songs. Never happened prior, keep the old SoundCloud!!!"
2612,Good music but ads every 2 songs,2,12/13/2021 21:04,Can’t even listen during the gym because of so many ads. I can understand every 4-5 songs but it’s every 2 songs I get and add that’s 30 seconds long and during the gym it gets annoying.
2613,Video ads must go,2,11/12/2021 1:23,There’s been countless times where the app has forced me to open it to play a video ad. Why is this a thing? I don’t mind the occasional AUDIO ONLY ads but the video ads have almost caused me to get into car accidents multiple times
2614,Hate one ad in particular will change if ad is removed,1,11/17/2021 1:11,I hate the ad with the child who goes “more please” and then proceeds to shriek after the father says no to whatever her request is. Crying children is the last thing I want to hear in between songs. Will rate 5 stars if ad is removed.
2615,I enjoy it very much so,5,9/29/2021 19:05,I’ve always liked SoundCloud and I use it over e Roy other music platform.
2616,Review,5,5/24/2021 19:45,This is such a good app for when your offline and online. I use this all the time!!!
2617,Why can’t I add this to favorites!?,4,9/14/2021 2:43,Ok so basically I was wanting to listen to Lisa manoban money and lalisa but it wouldn’t let me set it to favorites and it’s really annoying me so please fix that!!!
2618,yo I love SoundCloud,1,7/20/2021 18:05,"BUT PLEASE FIX THE LAG. anyone with hella songs in their likes can attest to the entire app suffering when you have over 1.8k liked tracks. It crashes at least once a day, sometimes just because im scrolling thru my likes! And then when I am able to go thru my likes it takes so long to load.😭"
2619,Great App!,5,5/21/2021 11:08,"It has minimal ads for me, good songs and new songs and even some remixes. Great recommendations and personal playlists. 5 stars."
2620,One love,5,2/13/2021 0:36,Sound cloud always lets me release my bad energy and replace with good. They have any Sony you could think of .
2621,Music selection,5,2/4/2021 7:10,So much good music to choose. Sound quality is on point.
2622,SoundCloud,5,1/28/2021 1:15,My favorite way to listen to music I highly recommend
2623,It’s gr8,5,12/6/2020 21:10,you can skip songs AND ads without paying for it
2624,Music,4,1/17/2021 3:23,Pretty good annoying that sometimes the songs are not the right song
2625,It’s Ok.. Not Very User Friendly,4,1/15/2021 11:16,Not sure why I can’t save certain songs or find songs that were previously saved..
2626,It is not fair,4,1/7/2021 6:50,"I live in Iran, I am a great fan 
I used to use this app on a daily basis.
It’s well organized and almost satisfies each and every of your music taste and mood.
But you banned us from using this app without vpn
And it is unfair.
It’s unfair cause using vpn in this country cost us double internet usage and even some powerful vpns won’t work here.

I hoped freedom in your country had not the meaning it has in ours."
2627,Listen history,4,1/6/2021 12:36,For some reason I can’t open my listening history
2628,Crashes,4,12/10/2020 16:27,"My app keeps crashing. I have had this problem before... 

But if it is a bug... pls fix it"
2629,Too much ads,2,12/10/2020 2:42,Basically after every 5 songs it’s a big ad that has like 30 seconds on it smh wish they was an app that didn’t have that if there was I would move right over
2630,Awesome app,5,11/29/2020 21:21,At first I questioned it but I started to use it all day long. Would definitely recommend.
2631,Good but no clean,4,11/2/2020 15:37,"Good app overall but there is no clean songs, also there is songs that you can get for free. But If you care about words this is not for u. 3 1/2 stars."
2632,Be smart,3,11/19/2020 16:03,"You know if you made your website so people could listen without signing up, they would probably sign up more often.. just sayin"
2633,Keeps unliked songs,2,11/8/2020 23:01,"Every time I unlike a song in my liked tracks, it just adds it back at the top. I click on it again to unlike it, and it just keeps it there. It is beyond annoying. Please fix this."
2634,Change your advertising,1,10/28/2020 12:31,Same 6 ads for over a month and 2 of them are in Spanish for some reason. Ads can no longer be skipped and if it’s a video and my screen is off everything stops. No value in paying for commercial free since it’s over priced.
2635,Honestly,5,7/30/2020 1:25,Best music platform of the century it allows people to listen to new music and people to put new music out there it’s so symbiotic and ahead of the game.
2636,I can’t even login,2,10/23/2020 18:20,"I’ve been trying to login but it won’t let me it keeps on saying “sorry, we’ve had a sever error”and it’s starting to get a little annoying, I’ve restarted my phone thinking that was going to help but it didn’t. :("
2637,Too many Ads,3,9/10/2020 17:26,No one wants to listen to music and have the mood ruin ever other songs with 30 second back to back ads.
2638,Honestly soooo amazing,5,7/22/2020 4:00,It’s kind of hard to use. But I just got it! The recommended music is spot on and I love the layout! 9/10 would recommend!!! ❤️❤️
2639,The best but to many ads,4,7/29/2020 6:04,I like it cause you can turn of your phone or play games and you still can listen to music but theirs to many ads
2640,I give it a 10,5,7/20/2020 23:20,My parents won’t give me ad but my parents can afford but still the best sound cloud the goat
2641,Rico love they don’t know,5,7/11/2020 8:55,Just honesty a perfect song about real events period....not gone be for brainwashed people who only believe in what they were taught as adolescents and beyond
2642,Great Sounds,5,5/31/2020 16:37,Easy place to find great songs to use in videos and of course just to chill. Love the indie vibe. Haven’t had any issues with the SoundCloud app.
2643,Good app but,2,7/4/2020 13:28,this is one of my favorite music streaming services and i love using it but every time i add a song to my playlist you guys make it premium like tf you should allow people to have the song if they already have it in their playlist before it goes premium just sayin
2644,"great, however",4,6/3/2020 4:28,"soundcloud is amazing, i’ve been using it for years but awhile ago i noticed in the dark mode i can’t see anything i type in the search bar, the text line moves and i can still type however no text is displayed. it’s as if i pressed the space bar a bunch of times. i expected it to be fixed rather quickly but it’s been months and it’s frustrating. 👎🏼"
2645,Great way to discover new music,5,4/15/2020 18:05,I encourage all up and coming artists to feature their music on this platform.
2646,Stop adding songs to soundcloud go,3,5/18/2020 2:27,Chill out with that because not everyone is gonna wanna buy it so stop forcing people to basically buy it so they can listen to their favorite songs not really fair if you ask me.
2647,Offline,5,4/13/2020 9:25,I wish there was an option to download audio (offline).
2648,I love this APP!,5,4/13/2020 2:52,I like how when your listening to music for a wile and your screen turns off but the music keeps playing
2649,Needs more promotion tools,5,4/3/2020 20:45,Get it if you love underground music. Been using SoundCloud for years great platform for upcoming artists. Check out my music Search MONEY TALK on SoundCloud .
2650,Y’all making songs that wasn’t premium before premium,1,4/9/2020 4:40,Y’all really doing too much a whole bunch of songs that was on my playlist weren’t premium but then all of a sudden they became premium. Y’all really could have left them regular. That was just green asf and that’s why y’all got this one star. I used to like y’all before y’all did that.
2651,Sound cloud,5,3/31/2020 8:00,It’s good to be able to play a game or text and listen to your music at the same time!
2652,Soundcloud,5,3/20/2020 19:13,Perfect to chill or when you wanna work out and not that many commercials
2653,Great app,5,3/18/2020 0:10,Great app love that you can’t have to shuffle play and you can stream songs without using data or WiFi
2654,Bribri,5,3/11/2020 17:49,This app is great to me because I don’t have to hear ads every ten seconds and I don’t have to listen to my siblings and that’s a good thing.
2655,My fav music app,5,3/3/2020 23:30,The music is great you can replay the songs unlike other music apps I have had in the past
2656,Rating,4,3/4/2020 8:01,I use this app for most ofthe songs I listen to but there are a few songs that I’m unable to find on this app
2657,SoundCloud Review,5,2/27/2020 2:09,"Hi , I just got Sound Cloud. It changed my entire life, just look up ""memes"" in the search bar and you won't be disappointed!"
2658,Best music app,5,2/24/2020 2:06,This app is the best in many ways. For the most part have always used SoundCloud for playing music. So many artists.
2659,Only the best,5,2/23/2020 13:33,If you make music of any kind or just enjoy listening to all the music of the underground then SoundCloud is where you want to be yo!
2660,Back to the old,5,2/11/2020 3:18,Why is everything go+ now😞
2661,My review,5,1/17/2020 12:17,I love this app now I can listen to my music without WiFi and they have clean songs so I can listen to my music and home thx
2662,Horrible,1,2/2/2020 23:59,"I’ve been using this app for years. One day it randomly decided to log me out and I could never log back in. It keeps saying there’s an error. I’ve tried signing up with different emails and it STILL doesn’t work. I’ve been trying to log in/sign up for months, but today I decided to give up and delete the app."
2663,2 years later and no track description,1,1/30/2020 23:29,Soundcloud doesn’t care about their users experience or amplifying voices of artists. It’s been two years since they responded to the complaint of not being able to see track descriptions in the iOS app and they still have done nothing about it.
2664,My review,4,1/19/2020 5:29,"I love, it has all the songs that I listen to but the down fall is that there are to many ads but after all everything is great."
2665,Awesome!!!,5,1/7/2020 4:06,"You can watch it without actually being on the app it’s awesome. Also, it lets you know what everybody else is listening to."
2666,Asadbek,5,1/5/2020 18:54,You can listen while doing anything and you also have skips
2667,Where I get all of my visual inspiration,5,1/3/2020 1:16,"Thanks to the access and diversity of all walks of musical genres, Ivan listen and see all sorts of creative genius that explodes in my brain. So thanks SoundCloud"
2668,Good content,5,9/3/2022 4:08,Has the different kinda tunes I’m looking for that others don’t have
2669,Love it,5,8/29/2022 1:45,I find little known musicians and songs that I have are hard time finding here. Great app!
2670,Best Sounds and Mixes,5,8/23/2022 10:56,Very happy to have discovered this app through a friend. I can’t put it down.
2671,SoundCloud,5,7/29/2022 16:42,"Best app ever to have!! Has songs I love to listen too, even some local artists as well is the best!"
2672,They need to make all of the songs available,4,8/6/2022 4:14,They need to make all of the songs available
2673,Music! To go!,5,7/6/2022 17:29,Great Upcoming artist! Find them first here! & easy to upload new music! Be come the next new artist! In Sounds cloud! Love it !
2674,SoundCloud Go crashes constantly,1,7/12/2022 18:30,"Im abroad in Italy and wanted to have my songs downloaded to listen offline; would’ve been a nice idea if the app didn’t crash every 20 seconds. Songs load fine, just takes me 30 minutes to listen to one song."
2675,I love it,5,6/19/2022 17:43,I love the songs and if your phone turns off its still playing
2676,Excellent quality of an over 50 yr speech,5,4/22/2022 2:21,The quality was excellent of an over 50 year old speech
2677,SoundCloud,1,5/23/2022 15:43,"I was going to give this app a five star but then I realized A$AP Rocky is on here. He stole everything from me. Rihanna was supposed to be mine and like the monkey that he is he stole her from me. Not only that but he impregnated her… that was supposed to be my child, my wife, my everything but he stole it from me. I hate him from the bottom of my heart I heart ASAP Trashy."
2678,Repeat issue,4,5/14/2022 21:10,Hi so idk why but every time i do a repeat on a song it would go in 10 seconds then the app turns off. I don’t know what to do.
2679,Interference,4,5/9/2022 18:41,There are random people blurting out things in the middle of an episode and background noise that’s annoying sometimes.
2680,Soundcloud—awesomeness,5,4/15/2022 19:24,"Quick, accurate, user-friendly…"
2681,Too many ads,3,4/18/2022 20:37,"Used to love this app, but it has so many ads now that it’s impossible to relax and enjoy. 
3 ads per 2 songs are a bit too much, very sad."
2682,"Barely any ads, play as much music as u want.",5,12/22/2021 0:45,I recommend Gold_Dolluh you should go listen to him!
2683,Good!!,4,3/30/2022 19:14,"The app is awesome and works perfectly, just one problem… my subscription is not working! I subscribed to soundcloud Go+ but it hasn’t been working."
2684,SoundCloud,4,2/16/2022 19:47,Only if SoundCloud could play songs online and offline at would be nice and I’ll recommend this app to all my friends and families.
2685,Its the best app for music,5,11/27/2021 0:58,Ive been using it for 2 years and i havent had any problems with it
2686,Review,4,12/15/2021 18:26,There’s select song that you have to pay for expecially the newer songs but other than that great app!!
2687,"Love SC, GO+ member 4 life",5,11/16/2021 14:34,"I can get whatever I want here ,the layout and ability to create personal playlists rocks too."
2688,Good but…,4,11/21/2021 3:01,Some songs you have to pay for and it is very strict in WiFi still recommended
2689,Great app,5,9/11/2021 16:50,"I’ve loved to listen to SoundCloud since 6th grade, I’m in 8th grade and still have that same account. The best music app in my opinion."
2690,Don. B,4,9/30/2021 8:13,Other than missing a few songs everything was spot on
2691,Fix this please,1,9/24/2021 15:05,won’t even let me update. good music and everything but won’t allow you to unlike certain songs so they stay in your likes and will play on shuffle. could be a breakup song and won’t even let you remove it or report it
2692,SoundCloud bug,4,8/8/2021 1:09,What is wrong with the app it will not let me upload any of my files and it’s very stressful fix this bug plz
2693,Very good app.,5,6/14/2021 12:16,"SoundCloud is easy to use, and the time stream is super handy to find specific bits of a program."
2694,Good app,5,5/30/2021 4:29,I’m glad you were able to take care of this situation
2695,Been using it for over 7 years,5,5/12/2021 20:28,"It only gets better, best of three evils."
2696,Amazing,5,3/17/2021 14:24,They should make it so that all songs are available tho
2697,I do like SoundCloud but one problem...,3,4/30/2021 0:53,"When I’m trying to sign in, it says error signing you in. I do have an account for SoundCloud but it doesn’t let me get in! Can you fix that?"
2698,Mining for gems,5,2/26/2021 17:32,I feel like I’m mining for gems every time I use this app. When you find those underground’s remixes 😍
2699,Best for starting artists,5,2/18/2021 4:34,I’m using this for creating music and putting it out and this is perfect for first starting.
2700,Kylie26,5,2/11/2021 16:25,Rlly good has all of the songs but can’t listen offline unless u buy premium
2701,Good music,5,2/11/2021 0:15,This is really good i like the movability that this give you and how you are open to a lot of thing
2702,Nice App,5,1/28/2021 3:08,"This is easy to use. I love Sound cloud for the variety, clarity of and variety of music. I also love the price. Thank you!"
2703,Make Soundcloud go 1$,1,2/7/2021 19:06,"If SoundCloud go were to be a dollar so many more people would pay the monthly and with such a dramatic increase in the amount of people having SoundCloud go you would actually make more money. Because you would have so many more people with monthly paying accounts.

If you like listening to ads this is the app  for you 
after every song there is at least 2 to 4 ads this is become the worst app in existence,  the people that own sound cloud sold out 

   Avoid this app     It’s a Constant headache"
2704,The sets go hard,5,1/26/2021 21:05,Recommended by a friend and find the best sets to work out or study.
2705,SoundCloud,5,12/21/2020 5:08,Love this app way better than any other music app for sure
2706,I can’t see my listening history,3,1/13/2021 4:14,It’s good but there’s one problem it won’t let me see my listening history to remove music I don’t know if it’s my phone or the app
2707,Insights needs,5,12/12/2020 6:23,You need to add the ability to see who likes what tracks and who commented what on the insights.
2708,It great!,5,11/28/2020 18:28,You don’t have to download music to listen to so you can save space.

2710,Top music app,5,11/22/2020 15:54,"Let’s be real it’s hard to beat SoundCloud. Limited ads, lots of variety, and great suggestions. <3"
2711,Great app but,3,11/17/2020 21:26,It’s a great app to listen to music but now I had to listen to ads after every song which gets annoying when I’m just trying to do homework.
2712,Make SoundCloud great again!,1,10/25/2020 19:15,"I’m surprised I’m not forced to watch/ listen to an AD before I type my review. Why do you guys push me to buy your expensive “Pro” service all the time? I don’t want it now, and I don’t want it in the future. I just want to find new music and artists without AD’s being shoved down my throat."
2713,Great app,5,8/23/2020 2:33,Sound cloud is a really app to find some songs that u can rarely find on other platforms

2718,One week,3,7/30/2020 19:59,This app was good the first year I had it but this new update where all my songs are on go+ is really making me want to delete it. I’m going to give them one week to fix it. If not then I’m going to delete the app

2725,"deep appreciation, but please..",1,5/19/2020 16:45,"i love soundcloud, it’s so convenient and accessible. 

though i would really like the feature of moving playlists order around, as in where you would like them to be displayed and in desired order of choice.

please add this feature. i want to make new playlists and such but they wouldn’t be in the order i would like them to be in, unless i deleted and recreated ALL my playlists which is beyond inconvenient.

2726,Love the app just fix the crashing,4,5/2/2020 0:17,Since the most recent update the app continuously crashes at random times really interrupts my listening
2727,Great App!,5,3/8/2020 12:19,I love that you can easily find a perfect match for any mood you have and listen to young artists from all over the 🌏
2728,SoundCloud Pro,3,3/21/2020 20:33,So many songs have been changed (specifically complaining about 90% of Lil Uzi Vert songs) to where you can only hear them with SoundCloud Pro. Now my whole playlist can’t even be listened too. Fix It.
2729,Crash,5,2/25/2020 14:34,Since I updated to latest version I can’t open the app. It’s crashing as soon as I open
2730,It doesn’t work,3,3/1/2020 15:32,"Every time i try to log in i would put my email and password and it wouldent work this is disappointing even i tried to put in a fake one it wouldent work either, very disappointing"

2733,Music the way it was meant to sound,5,2/4/2020 7:20,SC keeps getting better. Excellent mix of music from near and far. Discover what Inspires your life
2734,Go+,2,2/13/2020 13:33,I have been on SoundCloud since 2016 and now all the music I listen to is for Go+. I listen to music to help me fall asleep because I can’t normally. And this is really annoying because I can’t listen to good songs and I don’t have any money to buy GO. Please make all the songs go back to normal.
2735,Much Appreciated,5,1/16/2020 20:17,"🙏🏽Thx for the  App, hope whoever is listening likes what they’re hearing. If so, Like, Com, Share. Always looking for donators to help our next project come to life."
2736,Too ads,1,1/23/2020 13:17,Nobody wants SoundCloud go+ so ur gna need some better ads cuz the 30 second ads and the songs that play w then are horrible. Especially when u get 2 30 second ads just to lusted to one song. Like cool now I don’t even want to listen to that song by the time the ad Is done. And I’m definitely not the only person who thinks this.
2737,AdCloud,2,1/21/2020 20:08,"Soundcloud fell off. Having 30 second ads every 2 songs is ridiculous. Even getting the rare opportunity to skip, when your listening to music most of the time your phone is in your pocket or not on you. I miss the old SoundCloud."
2738,SoundCloud review,5,1/10/2020 11:09,This app is really good for high schoolers and to listen to when. Your doing a workout etc. I love this app so much this is my go to song app
2739,i LOVE the new user interface…. but,5,8/21/2022 3:02,"we REALLY need some filtering options for liked tracks, soundcloud!!!!!!"
2740,Ad,3,9/4/2022 2:19,"Great musics, not allowed to hear my good ones. The only thing I “Hate” about this app is that every 3 songs been played an ad about “vaping” pops up, like im legit “tired” of hearing “I need my vape” ad, like stop just STOP. Its driving me crazy."
2741,Search bar pay wall,1,8/30/2022 8:03,"You used to be able to search a song you like and play it, now you have to pay to do so, the most idiotic function ever, I already pay for ad free now I can’t easily find a song in my likes, can’t imagine the app going up from here"

2763,Liz:),4,3/2/2022 11:57,I like the app the only thing I don't like is that there is a lot of ads and they want me to pay to remove the ads and I don't like that

2771,SoundCloud’s stupid.,3,8/24/2021 2:51,"I downloaded this to listen to two thing. Night core, and ASMR but I can’t do that because SoundCloud keeps taking down so of my favorite ASMR. 
If one more of the ASMR I like gets taken down I swear I will delete this app."
2772,Brilliant,4,8/19/2021 21:21,This completely changes how we choose the music we listen to... Sound cloud unbundled music like twitter unbundled status updates.
2773,Using sound cloud for years,5,7/23/2021 18:13,"Love this app, been using for years"

I think it still needs bug fixes so if you guys could release a new update that would be great. Otherwise it’s a good app. A lot of ads but still.."
2777,It’s great,4,4/28/2021 18:02,This app is really good the add are not in you face as often so you can listen to the song and you have a great variety of songs.

2781,Great to listen to you can’t get better than this,5,3/6/2021 2:35,Everybody needs to try it☝️✅
2782,Can’t complain,5,1/31/2021 5:04,"Great app for music making ,no flaws with it now if you must I am going back to jam hugs and kisses"
2783,Needs an overhaul,2,2/8/2021 11:23,Really need to allow sorting by date and length of track... too many old songs and mixes appear in searches and can’t even see a history of what has been listened to before.
2784,SoundCloud problem,4,2/5/2021 13:35,"SoundCloud is back on my phone 
I have other app’s as will that’s not uploading

2788,TOO MANY ADS,3,12/25/2020 4:13,So I had SoundCloud for a long time and they ain’t use to have so many ads but now they have a ad like after every two songs like what the heck fix it cause I ain’t buying GO+
2789,Great quality,5,12/1/2020 22:20,Me and my sister turned up the radio and started jamming out this app is amazing 5 star is what it deserves ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2790,Love Sound Cloud,5,11/17/2020 22:17,Found some new artists that I would have never heard otherwise. Yippee...
2791,Recommended,5,7/31/2020 16:03,"I have no problem with it, you can find any artist or mix of your music choice."
2792,Ads,1,10/30/2020 16:35,"I love soundcloud. I used it almost everyday and found so much good music and tracks I couldn’t find anywhere else, but now I can’t listen to more than 3 songs before a 30 second ad starts playing. It ruins the vibe and just makes me close the app completely."
2793,Fix this ASAP,4,9/25/2020 21:16,I love this app but y’all just need to update the insights it’s saying 2016 but I didn’t drop my first song on SoundCloud until 2018 please fix that
2794,Pretty good app,5,7/25/2020 3:28,"App doesn’t have any issues and works quite smoothly, maybe an add every 20 songs but very rarely. Anyways I’m not fake or a bot I’m real 😀😀 yea ik who uses that emoji"
2795,Great for Musicians!,5,7/9/2020 18:32,"I have loved SoundCloud as my main platform to get my music out to the world, and it’s amazing to hear other creators throughout the app."
2796,Ads etc,4,7/23/2020 19:58,Everything’s good but the ads should have comments so we could comment about how dumb and stupid and annoying they are!
2797,Very Enjoyable,5,7/3/2020 2:35,The price is great. Love the ability to turn off the phone while listening to music.
2798,SoundCloud Review,5,6/27/2020 22:31,"I use SoundCloud daily and I also love music, so I hope SoundCloud maintains its good reputation and lowers the use in ads, as well as allow more music for everybody."
2799,The best of them all,5,6/27/2020 14:43,I would recommend this app to all my friends and family
2800,Creates opportunity,5,6/6/2020 1:32,This apps open doors that you wouldn't imagine could be open if you are a new artist exploring your creativity 👍🏾
2801,Messages,4,6/23/2020 20:42,The app is good in all but it need a messages tab I have to go on my computer that is really slow just to look at the messages so please add a messages tab
2802,Why the changes???,1,6/11/2020 23:43,"Why is all of a sudden every song on my playlist under Go+ now, yet a couple days ago it wasn’t? Soundcloud you’re really messed up for this, I along with many others, will be going to other music apps now because of your dumb decision to make this possible. Enjoy having less listeners."
2803,Sound Cloud,5,6/5/2020 2:00,There are too many new improvements but I still like it.
2804,Soundcloud🤟😶😈,5,5/16/2020 21:16,The SoundCloud app Is a great app to depend on for your bomb playlist you have❕This app holds a lot of Amazing features and I’m not just saying this to say it I’m being real
2805,🥱🥱,4,5/13/2020 17:52,"All i really gotta say is that, they really need to fix the bugs. The only real problem im having is just trying to edit a track, but it never lets me."
2806,Great music app,5,3/31/2020 7:01,This app is perfectly fine I got a lot of favorite songs. I have a nice playlist. Just keep doing what y’all doing.
2807,SoundCloud,3,5/10/2020 18:54,I like SoundCloud it’s great it has all the good music well the music I like but what I do hate is the ads you but 2 ads one with 30 secs and one with 11 you but 30 secs without a skip so you’re tryna make us by SoundCloud + by making get annoyed
2808,Music,5,3/20/2020 18:02,SoundCloud is a good app for music because you can actually find all the songs your looking for
2809,Can upload music,5,3/14/2020 20:24,Can upload music from my phone easy five stars

2812,Disable screen recording in app,5,2/22/2020 18:24,That way your song can’t be distributed on the black market of producing
2813,A great app,5,2/17/2020 2:41,It’s nice to listen to all my favorite songs and it’s all for free!!what a app to just come home and relax listening to whatever you like.
2814,The best,5,1/23/2020 2:45,It’s the music platform possible with all of the original music you can find on there
2815,Copyright,1,1/27/2020 18:02,You’re algorithm for taking music down because of copyright is dumb as hell. Anyone can report a song and it gets taken down in 24hrs. You guys have an issue of a lot of top artists getting their music reported and taken down though it’s all original work. You really need to fix this. It’s really affecting a lot of artists.
2816,Soundcloud gang,5,1/20/2020 20:21,Great way too play music I love it so much you can play music anywhere and I think everyone should try SoundCloud and I love it 💖❤️

2819,SoundCloud,5,8/18/2022 2:58,Better than any other music app
2820,Too many ads.,3,8/27/2022 2:19,"Far too many ads. Even for a free service, over time it’s gone from one ad every 10 tracks to one every 3 tracks. Disgusting."
2821,Perfect,5,8/15/2022 13:21,It has all the songs and it’s pretty good I love this app Because this app has all the songs I love

2829,Playlist,4,4/24/2022 2:10,Soundcloud this app is so amazing just one problem for me is the playlists not repeating. That’s all the problem I have with this app.
2830,About,3,4/21/2022 1:28,Pleased add the option to play one playlist and not playing it once and going on forever ♾ never 🔁 the playlist just goes on
2831,10-Oct,5,4/19/2022 2:44,It’s good I get to listen too my music and make playlists! I give it a 10/10

2835,SoundCloud Is Awesome,5,12/25/2021 2:31,I love this app… unlimited downloads and I haven’t found a song yet it doesn’t have!!
2836,Not downloading or turning on,2,1/3/2022 3:10,"I’ve been using the app for a few years now, but whenever I open it closes on its own and when I tried to delete it and redownload the app it cancels the download. Can’t use this no more."
2837,Ads on deleted songs?,1,12/26/2021 5:37,My favorite part of SoundCloud is when they play an ad before a song just for there to be a “loading error” because the song has been deleted and can’t be removed from your playlist.
2838,SoundCloud,5,12/16/2021 19:52,One of the Best music listening apps i have 10 outta 10 recommend
2839,Thrash,5,12/2/2021 21:35,I love it because it has songs that others don’t

2848,Needs improving,3,7/9/2021 4:57,"It’s great and all but when I wanna listen to a playlist, it starts to skip songs. Only thing good about is it also skips the ads😂but yeah it’s pretty annoying."
2849,not uploading,2,7/26/2021 6:47,"It won’t upload my song, I upload it and it says it’s uploaded then when I go off the app and back in the app my song is gone. Would give a higher review but please fix this bug"

2854,Developers made this app worse.,2,6/21/2021 19:32,"Developers removed total playcount and replaced it with general playcount, as well as placing the general playcount in a less visible spot. Bring it back. Why you would do this is beyond me. Two stars. Fix it and I will give a better review."
2855,Viewing plays,2,6/3/2021 21:08,"On this new update they ruined the way artists view their plays it’s ridiculous how I have to save a picture of my plays to view them, I wish the old way could be back."
2856,Very Laggy,2,5/23/2021 3:51,Soundcloud used to have a smooth user interface but now it’s extremely laggy especially when swiping down to search for songs. I have an iPhone 11 so I know it’s not my phone that’s laggy.
2857,Best app Eva!!,5,5/8/2021 20:54,"The best app ever!!

2863,Great app!,5,1/12/2021 1:36,This app is amazing! All you need to do is press “play” on most songs. As long as they aren’t songs owned by corporations.
2864,Nackerman231,5,1/11/2021 5:40,It’s a good app I just don’t like how some songs don’t show up as what there supposed to be.

2878,Ad problem,1,9/23/2020 6:06,"There are too many long advertisements. Even on songs that artists make no profit on. I guess the ads are just for SoundCloud itself to make money, but come on. 2 long and unskippable ads after every 3 songs is ridiculous."
2879,SoundCloud keeps crashing,3,9/16/2020 4:23,Whenever I typed in King Vendrick the app would shut off. I searched other songs and it had no problem what gives?
2880,Absolutely great!,5,8/18/2020 20:41,"I would recommend to everyone, there is not that much ads and acces offline!"
2881,Go+ problem,1,8/20/2020 7:12,I love the app but now a lot of songs like the majority got moved so I can’t listen to more than half of them . I used this all the time but it’s annoying now how they keep adding more till eventually I think  we’ll probably have to pay just to listen to music . It’s SoundCloud you know .free music . But not no more !
2882,Bestiary to get heard,5,7/5/2020 21:43,"Absolutely love Sound Cloud. Collaborating with other artist has never been so easy. It’s easy to be heard, and have your music make a difference.

2883,Lag problem,3,8/6/2020 8:44,"One thing I wish you guys can do is fix the lag problem, no matter how many times I update it I always get the lag problem, hopefully you guys will fix this issue"
2884,Clueless honestly.,1,7/27/2020 0:59,I have no clue what happened but i was listening to my music this morning and it was working fine. I was playing my music on my break. Then when i got home i even played it for a couple seconds then all of a sudden everything required SoundCloud Go+ just to listen to. So im honestly mad about it.
2885,Sound cloud,5,6/13/2020 1:27,Ideas plus music and you have soundCloud could there be a better name??
2886,Pay to listen,1,6/13/2020 20:54,Man I had a whole playlist of songs without me having to pay then the very next day every single song I have to pay so thanks for nothing it would be nice to listen and not have to worry about finances music is to destress not know that I’m paying just to listen to my songs
2887,Sound Cloud,5,5/30/2020 18:57,One of the best apps for Talk Radio and News! If you can't find it on Sound Cloud then it's not worth listening to !
2888,Removing go+ if you got WiFi,2,6/9/2020 13:04,"They should not have SOUNDCLOUD GO+ on all the songs if you got WiFi like let us have to buy subscription if we don’t have WiFi, don’t force us to get SoundCloud go+ for the people that uses WiFi for these songs and not have subscription"
2889,Easy uploads,5,5/30/2020 7:26,Easy to upload songs and share links
2890,Best music app,5,5/29/2020 20:33,I love this app it makes me remember all my songs and I don’t have to go back in forth to play my songs
2891,Email?,5,5/5/2020 6:22,"Great overall, But when I was trying to complete my account I wouldn’t get the verification email."
2892,Soundcloud rocks,5,4/12/2020 16:34,Awesome live sets and playlists for workouts!! If you’re Looking for new mixes and original music soundcloud has it all!!

2894,The Best!,5,3/27/2020 8:45,I’ve never paid for any sound service other than sound cloud. My favorite!
2895,SoundCloud,5,3/23/2020 13:22,It honestly gives me an opportunity to share my music to a much broader platform on an easy to use app! Thanks SoundCloud!
2896,This app,5,3/4/2020 20:12,I love the wide selection of music you slow us to have. You don’t even need a subscription!
2897,Not good!,1,3/22/2020 19:40,"I pay for the SoundCloud Go membership, unfortunately I won’t be renewing because my downloads keep un-downloading. It’s super annoying and it beats the purpose of their membership. I have more than enough storage in my phone to download music. Such a shame that I can’t enjoy my music on the go!"
2898,The update,1,3/8/2020 6:22,I’ve had a couple of songs on my playlist for a while and now and all of a sudden I need a subscription to soundcloud go so I can listen to them even though I had them in my playlist before I need a subscription why all of a sudden do I need a subscription to listen to music I already had
2899,Undeniably necessary,5,3/2/2020 20:15,We use as a platform to promote all our new music and share private demos and has proven to be the best use for us
2900,Rating App,5,2/23/2020 14:05,I love this app I can hear my music but I still hate it cause I can’t listen to my full songs or original music💀😭
2901,Just what my ears need (anti-radio),5,1/13/2020 21:37,"Update tightened up some funtion issues, been using this app since they first came out for all my indie music"
2902,Bug Report,4,1/24/2020 5:08,My app keeps freezing everytime I open it and click on the library tab.. plz fix so I don’t I don’t have to cancel my subscription.
2903,Availability,5,1/10/2020 17:56,"For some reason, a lot of Imagine Dragons, Travis Scott, and Drake song are unavailable. Is this something to do with SoundCloud itself or the artists themselves?"
2904,Soundcloud,5,1/8/2020 5:11,I love the variety of music and how everyone can upload their own sound
2905,Love it as a user,5,1/4/2020 6:26,"Sound cloud is always learning about me and bringing forth fabulous new music!!

2906,Music is Art,5,1/2/2020 4:19,Expressing what you feel through music is one of the most beautiful things:)
2907,☺️,5,9/2/2022 8:44,I’ve been using SoundCloud for years now honestly an amazing app have nothing bad to say 💕😮‍💨
2908,Please no ads,5,8/18/2022 13:51,"I always got frustrated by the advertisements,but I like SoundCloud"
2909,🤷🏾‍♂️,5,6/13/2022 16:39,I love this app and I recommend it to everyone but today it randomly stopped working out of nowhere and idk what to do sooo yeh
2910,Freezing with new UI,2,7/22/2022 16:02,"Ever since the new UI, the app will freeze after 2-3 songs play. Music will still play but you can’t press anything within the app and will have to force quit. Really annoying."
2911,I hate the new interface,3,7/11/2022 5:10,Please change it back everything is crowded now. It’s all smooshed. There was nothing wrong with the interface before!
2912,My review 🤓,4,7/6/2022 6:43,The app is good is that every time I skip like 2 songs a add comes up. I thought a ad comes up every hour 💀
2913,Waaaaayyyyyy better before the ad bombs every song they were different but not anymore,2,6/25/2022 8:18,The ad post are way to high how is it I end my playlist close out al the apps and when I come back into it it plays a ad first? That’s not cool
2914,No Darkmode,1,6/14/2022 12:39,"I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but there's no longer an option for darkmode. I'm not sure how this update would improve functionality, but visually it's suboptimal. I still appreciate the app and how it uplifts artists, but I'll be using it far less. I'll pay to listen to my music."
2915,Love the new UI Design,5,6/13/2022 2:05,Everything looks so much more organized with this new update. I love it!
2916,All my saved songs and playlists were erased,2,6/13/2022 14:48,It wouldn’t let me play my songs while on a road trip and when I updated the app all my things were gone and I still can’t play any music.
2917,Fix your app (June 2022),2,6/13/2022 13:58,The app was amazing before June but since this new update I can’t play any songs or even sign into my own account! At this point I’d start looking into using other music apps cause SoundCloud is just trash at this point.
2918,the update,4,6/13/2022 13:52,"my soundcloud updated and now it won’t show my songs or playlists so i tried logging out now everytime i try to log back in it says there was trouble logging you in, not only on the app but when i go on the website and log in it doesn’t show any of my songs, liked songs, or anybody else’s songs"
2919,Good app!,5,6/4/2022 1:17,I love SoundCloud it works but I hate when you get a 3 min long ad. But other than that it’s a great app.
2920,SoundCloud is fantastic!,5,5/14/2022 4:03,One of the best music platforms out that I have always used.
2921,Thank you,5,4/29/2022 17:37,Thank you for providing a place for us to create safe and soundly
2922,It’s good,3,5/12/2022 17:30,My SoundCloud keeps crashing when I’m listening to music and I gotta reset the whole app which is annoying becuz it restarts the song from the start
2923,My review,5,3/27/2022 17:21,It is a really good app and lets me play my fav song and I get to type the lyrics along with other ppl
2924,ads,4,4/14/2022 18:28,"SoundCloud is really good definitely recommend but the ads kill it, it’s just ad after ad"

2928,So many fake reviews,1,1/7/2022 16:11,"This app constantly crashes. Also, read the laundry list of basic reviews. They know the app is broken and instead of fixing it, they just pump fake reviews.

Definitely try using the app for a day before you pay for a subscription."
2929,SoundCloud,5,12/7/2021 12:46,"Had it for 5yrs, since Middle School straight up with no trouble,Preview New update is worth the wait ."
2930,Great App!,5,11/29/2021 18:28,I can find many songs that aren’t anywhere else!
2931,account got deleted twice,1,12/1/2021 3:14,"I'm honestly fed up with SoundCloud. I had two of my accounts deleted because I was ""violating the guidelines"" despite me literally violating none of them. There's no way you can appeal this and your account isn't even just suspended, it's deleted. SoundCloud is just not worth it."
2932,Highly recommended,5,10/5/2021 21:05,This app has always done right by me 💯
2933,Songs on Repeat,5,9/28/2021 5:51,I really love the app it’s amazing and there is so much music to choose from
2934,Ight,4,9/29/2021 17:01,It’s fine but when u like a song it sometimes doesn’t let you like the song
2935,Amazing app,5,8/21/2021 1:53,Love every song on here this is my second acct and I got my gf hooked to it too thanks for what y’all do
2936,Shuffle is a lie,3,9/24/2021 20:16,Shuffle feature is so bad it might as well be a lie. No other music streaming service has this much trouble shuffling a playlist. Extremely disappointing; please fix.
2937,Gotta love hidden tracks,5,8/6/2021 20:36,5 stars for having secret songs if you look! 😉
2938,Good app I love it but it has a couple of adds I wish it would work off internet 🙏🏽,5,7/24/2021 3:16,Love app

2940,Greate app,5,6/23/2021 14:45,Greate app free listening and the quality is awesome although there is some musics that u need to go plus to listen to
2941,Ads are becoming unbearable,1,7/8/2021 15:26,"I’ve loved this app for years but recently the ads have become absolutely awful. I’m hit with 60 seconds of ads after just 1 or 2 songs. At this point I’d rather just sit in silence than use this app, which is so sad considering how long I’ve used it."
2942,Best app for songs,5,3/17/2021 20:40,I love that there are all kinds of songs and it’s easy to access
2943,I like it,4,6/7/2021 22:28,"It’s a amazing app but it’s recently been not letting me like the songs I hit the button and it lights up and then turns white again

2957,Unusable,1,12/28/2020 21:26,"SoundCloud user for over a decade. The only reason I use the app is because the site hides most of my playlist when I’m on the phone.

SoundCloud keeps removing features. Navigation is unusable. Adds high jack the entire app, and no, pro offers nothing worth paying for."
2958,"Started Out Good, Then Now I Can't Use It!",3,12/18/2020 17:38,"I loved Soundcloud, barely any adds, good artists, but I have an old iPhone 6 and now I can't use it anymore because it requires iOS 13 :( Very disappointing."

2963,SoundCloud,5,10/20/2020 15:50,I’m an electronic music lover and I think every one that has the same taste as me should use SoundCloud.
2964,Yes,5,10/17/2020 16:22,This app is fire I can skip as much times as I want and the ads aren’t that long
2965,Love you ❤️,5,9/21/2020 17:37,I love this app it always has what I’m looking for and has other smaller artists that are very good .
2966,Mmmm,5,8/5/2020 22:55,What’s going on brah? I rate this app 5 stars cuz it’s awesome yes but when I like a song it doesn’t put it in my Liked Tracks? Why 😔
2967,Best hidden gems youll find,5,7/25/2020 19:51,"Originality, fresh sounds, fresh styles, and a great platform for music enthusiasts to network and share the love . Get some. Give some"
2968,Ads?..,5,7/23/2020 22:06,"I really love SoundCloud, but why 1/2 ads? Some things like pads and smoking can make someone uncomfortable. But I’m just saying, really great app though! 🤗✨"

2972,Very good,5,6/23/2020 22:24,Even if you spell the song name wrong they still give you the right song
2973,Everything,5,5/26/2020 17:16,Best songs you can find all underground songs
2974,The app doesn’t launch.,1,6/8/2020 14:48,For about a week now the app begins to launch but is left on the loading screen. It never loads into any part that would allow me to play music. I’ve updated my phone and I think two app updates have been released since I’ve started experiencing the problem.
2975,PLEASE FIX THIS,4,6/4/2020 19:17,litterally all my favorite songs r sound cloud go + and now i can’t listen to anything now because you made all the good songs go+ it makes me mad bec i cant buy the go + so

2980,So Great,5,4/28/2020 19:10,I Can Play The Song Over And Over Again And It Makes A Track By The Music I Listen To It’s Easy To Use And Has Every Song I Mean Everything
2981,Version 5.92.0 is awful,1,5/4/2020 20:31,"Within the last 24 hours the app has turned into utter garbage. Constant crashes and disconnects. No longer works with CarPlay without crashing. Force quits by itself every 20-30 minutes. I don’t know what changed, but it went from a reliable app to unusable literally overnight."
2982,Review,5,4/6/2020 10:27,Tbh. I didn’t think I would use it as often as I do. But after sitting down an thinkin of how often I use it resulted in the score.
2983,Would recommend ❤️,5,3/30/2020 13:55,It’s a good app for music offline options and also various artist
2984,Real Games,5,2/14/2020 21:33,Soundcloud app is excellent. I can easily search and get what I need. It integrates seamlessly into both my home and auto sound systems.
2985,Love it,4,3/20/2020 22:13,I’ve had this since it came out and it’ll never go anywhere. Ads and things like that are part of the free music. Download is a must
2986,Need fixes,2,3/20/2020 20:41,Sound cloud is not that good of a music app the reason I think this is because it gives you adds back to back and also they put music on were you have to pay for a subscription they shouldn’t do that
2987,Soundscloud,4,3/17/2020 18:46,"I can always find a good music when I want to study. Otherwise, I think it would not be a good option for listening to the new hot songs"
2988,SoundCloud pro.,3,3/12/2020 11:06,Use to be a five but they made everything SoundCloud pro! I’ve been using SoundCloud now but now half my playlist turned into previews! It’s annoying and honestly SoundCloud was my favorite app like it was rlly good but now it’s whack.
2989,I like it,3,3/4/2020 15:21,Just wish the users could move songs around the playlist and I also wish that the users could take songs out of playlists WITHOUT premium
2990,Sound cloud,5,1/6/2020 6:47,Has a lot of really good songs the only bad thing is that it doesn’t have highest in the room😔😂
2991,Pretty Good,4,1/2/2020 15:25,Its pretty good I like it a lot there are some songs not found on SoundCloud and also they show a lot of ads but overall everything is pretty good .
2992,too many music,5,8/18/2022 23:55,You got too many music for enjoy.
2993,I love the app,4,8/28/2022 6:21,I love it I just wished it didn’t made you buy premium in order to get paid for your songs
2994,Good useable gateway to the SoundCloud ecosystem,5,8/5/2022 0:01,It’s lacking a few details but overall it allows you to use SC on the go
2995,It’s amazing,5,7/28/2022 0:43,I like it because it is really loud and it has all the song I like to listen to 😁
2996,Amazing,5,7/19/2022 13:28,You can get all the unreleased music and only a little adds
2997,Won’t let you sign in,1,7/14/2022 22:18,All of my emails including my Facebook got labeled as spam by the bots in charge of log-in. I’m not able to create an account and the customer support page the app directs you to provides nothing in regards to helping you secure a sound cloud account.
2998,Fire ash,5,7/13/2022 2:41,would wish they had less adds but tbh adds aren’t that bad
2999,Unique music,5,5/18/2022 13:30,I enjoy searching and finding unique songs and music
3000,New format is horrible,1,6/15/2022 18:32,I have been using SoundCloud for 5+ years and it was my favorite most app to listen to music with. However with the new update and everything being bigger and redesigned it has really caused me to stop using this app as much as I’d want. Please revert to original.
3001,Check out our songs,5,5/8/2022 6:41,Best app for your favorite artist
3002,Not staying on play menu,1,5/14/2022 13:07,When I stop my music it stops on the play menu but after a sec it takes itself off and I have to go back into the app to start it up again and we’ll it’s ANNOYING to have to start over EVERY TIME please fix and I’ll give you’re app 5 stars
3003,love it,5,4/13/2022 0:09,"I downloaded soundcloud to find music, instead the music found me"
3004,SoundCloud,5,3/5/2022 21:09,Beta music streaming app definitely for up and coming artist

3007,Need to know whether an album is explicit or not.,5,10/3/2021 20:49,Great app otherwise keep it up!
3008,Its good,4,11/18/2021 15:37,It’s like all good besides the fact that it plays only one type of add 99% of the time so that gets annoying fast but it’s really good
3009,4 stars,3,10/15/2021 18:13,It works and functions as stated would be 4 or 5 stars if description was open-able and read-able
3010,I love it,5,8/29/2021 15:37,My brother freind filo gets to make his own music and me and everyone else can listen to it
3011,Bug,3,10/2/2021 1:44,They need to fix this every time I like a song it disappears I will like it and it will say saved to library and I will go to my library and it will not be there

3102,Review,5,11/30/2020 9:31,"Best app to use for homework, workouts, and etc all ur favorite songs and unreleased songs"
3103,Ads,2,1/27/2021 21:17,Too many advertisements and I like but it’s not coo after if ruins your vibe to the music then it take a 1 out of your songs for the advertisements and then plus you have some songs on premium

3109,Hi,4,10/17/2020 15:13,I love sound cloud but instead of the size being full screen it could be a simple square with the cover art
3110,I need a title that’s tough,3,8/15/2020 19:18,SoundCloud is a good music app but wat I don’t like is that they take the songs you listen to the most and add them to go+ that’s bummy tryna force someone to buy go +so they can listen to them songs you added to go+
3111,Why does it shuffle in the same order,2,9/28/2020 12:36,"Iphone shuffles in the same exact order everytime, I already know what song is coming next most of the time. Shuffle better."
3112,Love sound cloud,5,8/6/2020 1:52,Very informative able to connect with others coaching
3113,SoundCloud,5,7/21/2020 18:59,SoundCloud allows me to switch to any song I want at any time I like their fact that I can do this
3114,Please fix,3,7/24/2020 22:07,"After I listen to a couple songs it’ll just stop playing, even songs I have downloaded, I don’t like that I’m paying for an app that doesn’t even seem to work..."
3115,👀,5,7/14/2020 1:03,It’s very good and ads don’t come that often so but for some songs you can only listen to the privew but ists good so far
3116,Grate app but just one thing,5,7/11/2020 14:50,They need to stop putting adds of dip. It plays after every song.

3118,Recommended,5,5/25/2020 17:46,"Has a large variety of music , its easy to use, the app works well"
3119,Problems,3,6/2/2020 13:09,"Ever since the newest update (5.94.0) I’ve been getting signed out at random, given no one has my account info, also it has been freezing more frequently"
3120,SOUNDCLOUD IS A GOATTT,5,5/14/2020 16:45,This app is truly reliable and you can jam out to any song buttt if your a kid there is no clean songs so I say like 14 years old or older.
3121,Crashing,2,5/25/2020 6:02,"As of the last recent update whenever I click on the app it instantly crashes. I have been waiting for an update to fix it but figured not enough people are reporting the same problem so, here I am! Please fix!"

3124,Life line,5,4/6/2020 0:14,Sound cloud has been a life line to me on many occasions and for different reasons. Wouldn’t be without it !
3125,Good but Annoying at times,5,3/18/2020 2:55,It’s a good app but when it puts all my music for SoundCloud go it gets annoying
3126,download fix,3,3/21/2020 1:21,MY songs keep un downloading and its making me mad. so fix it because if im paying 13 a month it should remain downloaded not glitched out. so soundcloud fix it before you loose customers.
3127,Love this app!,5,2/23/2020 17:51,This app is the best! It has all of the music and remixes I want. I don't have anything bad to say about this app!
3128,Please fix the playlist bugs,4,3/17/2020 18:22,"I enjoy the app a lot, but my rate would have been a 5 star if the app would let me edit my playlist."
3129,Music,4,3/16/2020 21:08,I’ve used SoundCloud for a while and they just added all the songs on my playlist GO so now I can’t listen to the music anymore
3130,An entire new world,5,2/23/2020 0:20,I was introduced to this by a bunch of young people a few years ago and just love it.
3131,Is anyone else having this problem?,3,2/14/2020 5:58,I’ve had this app for about 3 months now and it’s great. It really is. But for some reason it’s kicking me out and glitching suddenly...can we fix any bugs please?
3132,Awesome to listen to music with,5,2/9/2020 18:39,"Love this app overall! Very very content with it, and trust me, I’m not usually the type to leave a review on an app. This app is just that good :D"
3133,It all gone!,1,2/11/2020 15:28,Yooo so I’ve loved SoundCloud for all it’s free music and I really don’t care for the ads but I refuse to buy plus and now all of a sudden almost every thing on there that was once free to listen requires plus! So now I can’t really listen to most of my music and now require to delete it sorry...
3134,simple app to use to listen to,5,2/6/2020 4:32,"not a pain to use soundcloud. recommendations are some excellent choices, but some songs can really repeat. offline listening is really nice; i can listen to music on the road without soundcloud go+. i consider getting soundcloud go+ if updates don’t change soundcloud in a bad way to support."
3135,Pretty good,5,1/11/2020 2:51,It’s all god but I think you can’t listen to music offline that’s one thing but still five stars
3136,Next update,5,1/11/2020 0:01,Hey on your guy’s next update you should put lyrics in the music so people learn the music easier
3137,Comments,4,1/6/2020 0:51,Y’all should put a limit on the number of words you can write cause it starting to get  ridiculous.
3138,This app is good,5,7/31/2022 16:02,I think it’s good bc you can skip as many songs as you want
3139,Big Glitch,2,9/2/2022 0:11,I’ve loved this app for years but recently I’ve been mired in ads literally between every track and now my entire like list has completely disappeared! This is just unacceptable.

3144,Horrible,1,6/11/2022 16:56,UI says it hates both the listeners and the creators. Why can’t I take a link from social media to the app directly? Why does it always redirect me to a link on safari or the App Store? This app is broken and horrible I hate it and you guys should be ashamed of yourself putting this out
3145,update,5,6/2/2022 18:21,Love the music sound cloud will always be in my heart but why can’t I ge the update 😭
3146,I want my money back,1,6/4/2022 1:23,I literally got the free trial and they took my money just now. Don’t do the free trial they will take you’re money on sight .

3153,Moving on,1,3/30/2022 13:46,"SoundCloud doesn’t have enough premium features or content to justify paying a monthly fee, and the free version is so add riddled it’s become unbearable. The video ads that require you to keep the app open or they will pause are the singular worst experience of all time"
3154,Amazing 😍,5,2/12/2022 4:55,I love this app it hits all the music from new unknown artist or from artist who blew up and all their unpublished stuff
3155,Ungettable Gets,5,1/17/2022 23:18,There are songs on SoundCloud I can't find anywhere else!! Love it!
3156,No Other App!,5,12/12/2021 15:18,SoundCloud will forever be a staple app it’s the only “professional” app that lets you listen to music in the BACKGROUND for FREE!
3157,"pretty good, but pro+ isn’t needed",4,1/9/2022 0:36,"Pro+ is really annoying, some of the official songs need u to buy membership for it smh."
3158,Soundcloud go+,1,12/20/2021 7:02,"I decided i wanted to try souncloud go+ so i bought it, i was pleased with it yet i found something that was cheaper so i canceled it, yet I went to go to the cheaper one and said insufficient amount, and it turns out it took my money even after canceling the subscription."
3159,My new favorite song app💜,5,10/29/2021 3:45,So easy to use and has all the best music!
3160,Looping playlist,4,12/11/2021 8:51,App needs the ability to loop playlists and not just songs on iOS
3161,New bug,4,11/18/2021 13:32,"Hello, I love SoundCloud so much and was wondering if you can check out the app rn bc i am unable to check artist profile or tap on it."
3162,Beast app,5,10/4/2021 7:55,I just love this app because it has new songs and unreleased songs and it’s just amazing!!!
3163,Pretty good to listen to music,4,10/18/2021 1:38,9/10 because j have to listen to music but you can listen to music off app
3164,Yes,5,9/26/2021 16:53,Why would t you get a app that plays every song in existence?!
3165,Review,5,6/24/2021 21:53,I love it! It just bothers me I can't listen to the music while playing video games
3166,ad problems,2,8/26/2021 16:10,Really good app but the ads are way to much two ads per song thats just frustrating eather fix it or give the subscription for free cause i want to listen to the music not your sponsors
3167,Doesn’t know how to leave you alone,1,8/25/2021 22:49,"When listening to a playlist or to an artist songs it’s constantly added other songs to the playlist, ones that I don’t want to listen to, and there’s no easy way to turn that off."
3168,Crashing?,1,7/26/2021 6:04,"So there is a bug in the system with soundcloud and the xbox app store and when you go to play a song it crashes and you cant even enjoy music at all and whatever you get out of it would always be frustration and anger. Trashy app on xbox, update it."

3172,Great app,5,6/12/2021 18:49,I like that I don’t have to stay on the app for the music to keep playing
3173,It’s good but..,4,6/13/2021 6:05,I love the app but the vape ads are so triggering like i would buy premium but i don’t have the money and i’m tired of hearing “you might be addicted to nicotine”
3174,i love this app but..,5,4/16/2021 1:13,"i love this app, i get to listen to my favorite artists unreleased music. if i could change anything, it would be to show you own playlist on the main page (when you first open the app). and a great addition would be making a widget!!(for iphone)"
3175,Amazing,5,4/5/2021 10:54,I knew there was better remixes then the original song. 💙
3176,Best music app,5,4/3/2021 13:50,Easy to use. Easy to navigate and reliable. 5 star all the way
3177,Seeyouat9ine,5,2/25/2021 18:46,My love for you has only growth. Your beauty is replaced and astray shall be doubt. Thank you for posting my music.
3178,Would recommend,3,3/16/2021 3:06,Only feature I would add is a play queue longer than the next song.
3179,BEST APP EVER,5,2/17/2021 17:39,"Really good app! And you even can listen music from tik tok!!!

3182,Cool site,4,1/13/2021 22:45,Cool site to post your music and share with friends… And the public... would like to see more promotional related integrations though.
3183,Great app,5,12/8/2020 23:14,"Gives you variety of music, to me it better then you tube."
3184,Fire,5,11/11/2020 6:43,It’s goes to the exact song I want unlike Pandora 🙄🥱
3185,Great way to find new music,5,10/27/2020 22:42,I’ve discovered so much amazing music from this app
3186,Suggestions,5,8/23/2020 17:14,"Could we get a queue button? 

Solid app. Love the extra music from all the underground producers."
3187,Good But make ads skippable,4,8/28/2020 18:21,The app overall is great but I just wish there was a skip ad feature. Because sometimes I just wanna jam out not hear a don’t vape ad.
3188,Music not found other places,5,7/31/2020 23:04,I love that SoundCloud has so much music that’s hard to find elsewhere.
3189,Good app but one suggestion,3,8/15/2020 11:59,This app is great and I love it but there should be an option to control how loud or quiet we want the music to be. It would be very convenient and I would rate 5 stars if it had that option. That’s all
3190,Not bad,5,7/25/2020 13:13,Haven’t had a problem uploading music at all with the streaming app
3191,Perfect app,5,7/12/2020 7:38,Thanks for providing hours and hours of my high school years of music and the constant supply of new music.
3192,Music,4,7/18/2020 8:19,It doesn’t let me play any music. I always have to restart the app multiple times for it to work. Please fix this issue.
3193,Music is amazing,5,7/12/2020 1:03,Amazing music audio quality and free offline listening. Great app and would recommend
3194,Attention,5,5/26/2020 12:39,Edit playlist name should be improved
3195,Adds,2,6/30/2020 13:05,I really love SoundCloud and I enjoy using it but the more I do the more adds I get. I’ve had this app for a while and it was never like that. Now there’s sometimes 3 adds between songs. I didn’t mind an add between songs but 2 is annoying. 3 is absurd and stupid.
3196,great but now...,3,6/28/2020 22:51,"I loved soundcloud at soon as I started using it but these past few months I started getting more ads and they put a lot of songs on soundcloud go+, which I can't afford."
3197,Pay,3,6/23/2020 21:26,I loved soundcloud but I started to dislike it after they make us upgrade to listen to are favorite music again and some people can’t get the upgrade
3198,It good but not great.,4,6/16/2020 21:29,I hate the fact that you have to pay after a certain amount of time. It’s still a good service.
3199,Inappropriate,3,6/16/2020 1:21,"I’ve seen comments saying want to see me play with my p*ssy 
And or: links to a nude website with naked people filming! And we should have cyber s*x like ew fwi children see these I want to speak with a employee"
3200,Soundcloud is amazing. We all know this,5,5/16/2020 1:05,Five star review. Just download. Everybody uses it. It’s amazing and has no bad things about it. Everything is great. 👍🏼
3201,amazing! but one small issue,4,5/19/2020 2:24,"first of all, i wanna say that this app is amazing. it feels like there's a lot more songs then apple music. and i like that you can make your playlist public or private. there is one small issue though. sometimes when i comment on a track, it glitches out and doesn't record my comment. idk why this happens but please fix this bug."
3202,Soundcloud review,5,5/15/2020 23:30,Best app out there for music amazing artists and even better music. 10/10 hands down for me. 🤪🤪
3203,i can’t get it back,5,4/14/2020 3:54,i love soundcloud i use it everyday i had all my favorite music on there and everything but i accidentally sign out and i can’t remember the password or the email all i can get into is my old one and i don’t remember the names of the songs is there anyway u could maybe get back my account?
3204,Copyright infringement issues,1,5/15/2020 22:27,"I had an account but there were some songs that I have put in the information to let the app or the company itself that it isn’t mine and now they terminated my account. I really love their app but when it comes to copyright infringement, I don’t think I can trust them any longer."
3205,Great app,5,4/3/2020 17:14,Is useful to find some songs that are hard to find on other app.
3206,It’s a really good app to use for music,5,3/29/2020 5:06,I personally think everyone should have this app because it’s free and useful
3207,Broken,4,3/31/2020 5:12,Look guys I love your app n all but y’all gotta fix it. Cause we can just switch to another platform anytime if we want but we choose you so.....
3208,Free music 😔,4,3/29/2020 18:52,Maybe if soundcloud let u play all the music then I would love this app even more but don’t get me wrong it’s a good app to listen to ur music just there shouldn’t be payments 😔
3209,Soundcloud rating,5,3/21/2020 5:55,When I’m on the bus I can listen to my music without being online
3210,SoundCloud,5,3/14/2020 11:21,It’s great and has any song I want to listen to right here and it’s so easy to make a playlist.
3211,fine,4,3/16/2020 1:00,You can’t play certain song unless you play but other than that this app is amazing
3212,AMAZING,5,3/11/2020 0:12,"recently started trying it out, and i absolutely love it! definitely would recommend:))"
3213,SoundCloud GO,3,3/4/2020 1:15,I don’t know how to react to this but it has happened twice now. It is saying most of the music in my liked section that were never on SoundCloud GO are on there now. I love the app but fix this please.
3214,Fantastic streaming device,5,1/29/2020 11:17,"I love listening to mixes on the app while studying, exercising or cleaning in the house. No issues so far."
3215,Great app to discover new songs made from independent artist,5,1/19/2020 18:55,Highly recommended if you wanna discover new music and artist
3216,Small,5,1/19/2020 18:46,"Downloads quickly, doesn’t take up a lot of space. Streams nicely."
3217,This the plug,5,1/19/2020 3:28,I love how there’s unlimited skips and most of the songs that you like are likely to have it in this app. You should really download fr fr.
3218,Great platform to create music,5,1/3/2020 7:49,Great content creation platform where it’s easy to make friends and fun and easy to use.
3219,Great app,5,7/12/2022 11:32,It’s a great app it has all genres of music and and doesn’t play a lot of adds
3220,Some playlists missing,4,8/25/2022 20:57,Some of my playlists are missing
3221,SoundCloud,3,8/12/2022 4:35,Let’s update the app to fix the bug where you click listen in app and it brings you you to the App Store instead
3222,it’s good but,4,8/1/2022 16:51,"App was better before make over, now I run into error checking insights on my phone"
3223,the liked songs,3,7/31/2022 11:29,I don’t know if there’s a limit or not but it won’t let me add anymore songs and I’m kinda sad that I can’t save anymore songs to my liked trac

3225,Love is Love,5,6/9/2022 17:30,I love this app so much. Been using SoundCloud since 2013. Never really had a problem with it.
3226,Bad,1,7/11/2022 5:23,"The worst of all the music apps ever created is soundcloud! You are sent to a paywall and forced to subscribe if you want to listen to a certain song. Before, there were no ad breaks between songs; suddenly, there are! We are unable to rename playlists in 2022?"
3227,Listening History,2,6/22/2022 6:39,What happened to the clear listening history feature ? You can’t do that in the new update. Please bring it back.
3228,Horrible update,2,6/13/2022 16:02,What happened this update caused everything to stop working I can’t access any songs and everything leads to an error worst update please change it back!!!
3229,Soundcloud stream is an excellent platform!,5,5/21/2022 18:12,"Soundcloud stream is an excellent platform!

3233,Write a review,4,4/24/2022 13:34,It is a good way to lesion to music but I am 12 and it says 12+ and it said I was to young for the app and now I have to redownload it so I put 4 stars

3237,Great App.,5,10/9/2021 4:37,Let’s just say that I wake up Listen  to Sound Cloud and go to bed Listening to “MY” Favorite Tones in it!!
3238,Timer,4,11/13/2021 3:23,"Could you guys add a sleep timer,I would like that. Rather then stopping the music or pausing it. I would love that feature"
3239,4 years,5,8/9/2021 8:04,I been using this app since 2017 and still do til this day. I love this app so much!!!!
3240,Not so smooth operator….,4,9/28/2021 19:11,The review misses one star ‘cuz I’m new to using it and its a bit confusing….but with a universe of songs to explore I’ll keep trying……
3241,Must have app,5,7/14/2021 22:18,"Find all spectrums of projects, it supports our artists.  Find new groves here , first."
3242,Stupid,2,7/26/2021 9:57,"This app is the worst app EVER you can’t listen to music without internet this app is really bad but spent 2 hours making a playlist later knowing I can’t loan to it with not WiFi 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎

Don’t ever get this app take my opinion it true"
3243,I love you clouds,5,5/22/2021 3:20,This platform has changed my business and life...👍
3244,🙄,4,6/24/2021 2:21,Sadly i lost my account and idk how so i deleted SoundCloud so i can make a new account it didn’t work so ima try to login in again
3245,more options to settings please,3,6/8/2021 5:05,"great app, definitely the best for music since you can find many songs on here. but i wish there was more options in the settings like changing the email your using. i lost my old account and i can’t get it back so i had to make a new one and re-like every song i’ve found sometimes the settings can be confusing"
3246,awesome music,5,5/16/2021 20:36,"i LOVE this app, free music and all, but maybe you could lower the ads a little? if not totally understandable :)"
3247,SoundCloud,5,4/24/2021 20:25,SoundCloud is dope !! The best audio sharing app to me. As long as I have been on the platform it has increased more listeners. Thanks SoundCloud ✌🏾
3248,basically flawless until recently,4,5/2/2021 13:22,"ive been using soundcloud for a couple years now and its worked fine for the most part, but recently i noticed that scrolling through playlists/artist profiles and such has been very laggy and choppy. its super irritating but other than that i still love this app"
3249,Sound cloud,5,1/1/2021 5:45,This app is awesome I highly recommend downloading on any phone
3250,SoundCloud rocks,4,3/14/2021 13:31,"But the interface isn’t conducive to finding your own stuff to share. Great for exploration, though."
3251,These ADS gettin OUT OF CONTROL.,3,3/10/2021 14:13,These ads getting outta control. That’s probably the only reason I stopped using this app years ago. It’s STILL a HUGE issue. This app had gone down unfortunately.
3252,Rate,4,3/3/2021 18:06,"I give a 4 because half of the time SoundCloud got good music but ion wanna hear no remix of a person who can’t rap ☠️,, i wanna hear the right song 💕."
3253,iOS version,1,2/27/2021 0:35,"I can’t control the updates from Apple, so my iOS isn’t compatible with your app. Please allow me to access your app even if my iOS isn’t the most up to date. Apple controls those updates- don’t make your app not work on this platform."
3254,Amazing,4,1/28/2021 6:14,This app is really good because of the music variety and how you can make your own. Not the best app but extremely good!
3255,My love,5,12/5/2020 21:47,Always been a fan of what SC does for artists starting out. Will always support.
3256,One thing,4,12/6/2020 4:49,I don’t have inbox please update so I don’t need it and if you do that I can give five stars thank you.
3257,Awesome,5,11/24/2020 20:07,You can find any song on hear it is the best truly
3258,Ads have ruined the app,1,12/3/2020 0:11,"Been a soundcloud user for several years, but the ads make this unusable now. I understand you have to make money, but hearing adds after every other song (or sometimes every song) is unbearable"
3259,Best Music App Ever,5,10/23/2020 23:24,"Haven’t had a single ad, has my top favorite music for free, no complaints, it’s just perfect, I love it."
3260,It’s a good app but,4,11/18/2020 18:52,Most songs should get approved because some songs have the title but it’s not the right song
3261,Wish I could find more songs,4,11/6/2020 23:31,Wish I could find more songs
3262,Disappointed,3,10/28/2020 16:50,The only ads I ever hear are for fast food. SoundCloud must support the growing obesity issue in this country. It’s disgusting to me that the only ads played are for fast food chains.
3263,Give me a break Vivien VEE remix (Glenn Rivera),5,10/23/2020 0:32,"Fabulous remix of a super exciting disco song… The original is hot, but this remix really pumped it up even more! Absolutely enjoy it!! Thank you."
3264,Love this app 🇦🇫,5,9/19/2020 1:34,The only thing that I do not like 30 seconds adds
3265,Need help ASAP!!,1,10/17/2020 0:58,This app saved my life and without out it I wouldn’t be who I am today. I’m an artist and I try my best to put out good quality music and I recently got a new phone and everything transferred but for I was logged out and for some reason I can’t log back in on IOS app. Pls I need help!!
3266,Reasoning,4,9/30/2020 20:51,"Don’t get me wrong, I love this app. However, the app tends to crash a lot and I feel that if that wasn’t the case it would be perfect"
3267,Great,5,7/14/2020 3:22,It’s the best it has all the songs u can think of and some different ones and u can be a creator
3268,The app is solid,4,8/3/2020 4:09,This app is solid I just wish it had less ads and more rapper songs without the Go feature
3269,AWFUL!,1,7/29/2020 21:18,"The iOS Version is now giving me stupid errors like “Access Denied,” “Couldn’t Sign In,” and so much more. Even when I already verified my email, I still get these errors! Believe me, this is the new version. They have to let people sign in! How can I listen to hymns without signing in?!"
3270,Great way to fond u released songs or ones that are not for-sale,5,6/25/2020 9:14,Great way to fond u released songs or ones that are not for-sale
3271,Good! Just have one problem,4,7/13/2020 13:49,So when ever I go and play music and draw digital. The app I use to draw on is IbisPaint X  and so when ever I draw the song pauses itself. Please fix this!
3272,Is pretty good,4,7/7/2020 15:09,When they remove songs from non buying one I wanna buy it but I’m not sure how much they will be fully charging a month
3273,Yeerrrrrrrr,4,6/29/2020 8:41,App is dope but literally all the songs went go+ in one night it wasn’t like that a few days ago why does it happen to every song !??!
3274,Freezes,4,6/28/2020 1:57,"Been using the app for sometime now and the only thing that’s wrong with it is, it freezes a lot 😞"
3275,It’s gangster,5,6/20/2020 22:13,Has almost every song you can think of + more
3276,Saved me,5,6/17/2020 18:43,This literally saved me and it’s free for me to use and have to listen to all my fav songs for free and any song slowed down or not I love it! ❤️🥺
3277,Awesome,5,4/5/2020 15:34,Soundcloud has always been a reliable source for streaming music especially for the young and upcoming artist
3278,Glitchy,1,5/20/2020 18:13,Constant loading errors. Commercials cause glitches and freezing. If I happen to have to restart during the commercial u have to restart it again. It won’t let u proceed for the day until you’ve managed to play though the whole commercial. U will get stuck in a loop.
3279,It’s ok,3,5/7/2020 18:37,So when I let my child use this app to listen to music I didn’t realize that there were comments on the song that had cussing and nude links please hide any comments on sound cloud
3280,Bugs,4,5/5/2020 14:02,I like SoundCloud but there’s a bug that randomly makes every song for Go+. And it happens to songs that aren’t usually Go+
3281,MAD,1,5/1/2020 3:52,"first of all, this is an amazing app but for some reason — just started today — everytime i try to like a sound it unlikes it??? like by itself. 

i’m honestly annoyed ‘cause i really wanna save these sounds. i’ve tried signing out, deleting and re downloading the app, etc.. it just WONT let me like stuff today. fix this please!!"
3282,Needs major update,2,4/22/2020 0:06,"App is slow, clunky, and crashes all the time. Not to mention it’s relatively inconvenient to navigate to your profile.  The latter I’m not as concerned as I am with the fact that it constantly crashes and freezes."
3283,Soundcloud,4,4/12/2020 20:53,"Functional in all aspects. Great way to discover new artists. Maybe not as streamlined for new users, but you get used to it quickly"
3284,Really good,5,3/30/2020 12:42,I can listen to sooo many different people and find out how people translate there thoughts and feelings into words
3285,Best Song,5,3/12/2020 2:29,This song has been my favorite since it came out
3286,Free Music,5,3/7/2020 15:28,"I can listen to any songs without paying anything for it
That’s what makes this app great"

3317,Unacceptable App Privacy — Why “Sensitive Info”?,1,11/4/2021 1:44,"One star because it’s unclear why this app collects “Sensitive Information” in TWO App Store privacy categories — including “Used to Track You”.

I’ve removed the app from my phone and will use the website instead.

I urge the developers to find a way to get the job done without so many types of data collected.  

***Or at least explain which data is being collected in a way that aligns with the App Store App Privacy categories and is conspicuous on SoundCloud’s App Store page."

3361,A little bit of problems.,4,6/18/2020 6:53,So sometimes. Go into SoundCloud the way it’s not going around  to My music and I bothers me. I don’t like it a lil now. Creepy stuff Ha And sometimes creepy stuff and it scares me
3362,Everything went Go+,1,6/16/2020 18:43,"Today, I woke up and loaded souncloud on my phone. The majority of my saved songs were now playing for only 30 seconds because they went GO+. I checked my sisters phone and the same artists and their songs were not go+ for her, but they were for me."
3363,Not what it used to be.,1,6/11/2020 13:26,"SoundCloud used to be one of my favorite apps to listen to music, especially considering it’s music from EVERYONE and it’s free to upload.

3425,Different music/better,5,3/12/2021 3:42,"Music you can’t get from other apps, it’s dope🔥"
3426,Not as advertised,1,3/15/2021 23:41,They market this app to be able to search song by singing or humming. First of all the humming doesn’t work at all. The ONLY song it was able to find by me singing was the “I love you” song by Barney. I literally sang “WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?!” And it couldn’t even find that.
3427,Great,5,3/11/2021 8:22,I love it and it has so much to give its like amazing 10/10 would get
3428,Why SoundCloud is worth downloading,5,3/5/2021 20:52,I feel like SoundCloud helps a lot of small rappers and singers.
3429,SoundCloud,5,3/2/2021 3:32,"Great app, has everything your looking for"
3430,This app is amazing,5,2/11/2021 4:53,"This app will let you Lessing to all the songs in the world.
The ads aren’t that bad ether."
3431,Button issue,4,3/1/2021 23:10,I’m trying to re instal it and I’m signing in clicking done and nothing is happening
3432,My account,3,2/17/2021 3:44,The app keeps logging me out on my Account and it’s annoying because this is like the fifth account I’ve made and I’m mad about it so fix it
3433,To many ads,3,2/13/2021 15:41,Every time I start the app up after the first song it’s always an add. Lot of times if I skip a song I’ll get an add it’s annoying
3434,LOVE IT,5,2/6/2021 19:39,"It’s such a good app! You can find songs you like slowed and original. There are rarely any adds, which I LOVE!!!!!"
3435,Watch App,5,2/5/2021 18:14,I really love this app as like a like love my Apple watch. Please make a watch app. This is must have thing for me.
3436,Soundcloud(:,5,12/15/2020 17:14,I love SoundCloud it’s got songs that a lot of other apps don’t and there such good songs
3437,App dope ash,4,1/3/2021 11:51,"I normally use Apple Music but I found SoundCloud got all the unreleased sofaygo, carti etc and I may be using this normally now bruh. It’s free as well and not really many ads. 4.8/5"
3438,Very good,4,12/27/2020 18:41,Sometimes you need find a good version of the song but there are some really good songs on this app
3439,Amazing,5,12/11/2020 20:14,I listen to music in this app for hours and hours
3440,Good but some flaws.,5,11/24/2020 8:27,Every comment section is either someone promoting their music or it’s a p*rn ad
3441,Advertising,2,11/26/2020 2:53,I get that they want you to buy the premium but that doesn’t mean play an advertisement after very song... simply makes me want to delete the app as whole.
3442,"Listen, SoundCloud",2,11/5/2020 0:52,"Considering all the spam accounts and very real possibility that some of them may try to steal your music, etc. SoundCloud is in very serious need of a way to block accounts of our choosing."
3443,I have a question!!!!,1,11/7/2020 0:08,I’ve had this app for awhile now I like it but all of a sudden it’s saying half my songs aren’t available for download I’ve paid the monthly fee so wth is going on?! I’ve tried re- downloading and it’s still saying that Am I doing something wrong?
3444,Dark mode,5,9/26/2020 6:29,Thought there was no dark mode but I found it :)
3445,Ads,3,10/30/2020 17:34,Bruh you can barely listen to music they put soo many ads even if you switch the song once not good
3446,Good but hard to find good music,3,10/28/2020 0:22,Awful music selection on the upload. Full of no name college DJs because I accidentally searched a song that has the same name as a college sports pod caster :/
3447,They still charge,1,10/23/2020 16:18,They still charge after changing phones under other name and if I want to down load apps they want you to put a card and it still under other person profile.  Very sneaky.
3448,ads,4,10/5/2020 17:15,all good but they have a lot of ads recently and i hate how some songs are only for Go or Go+.
3449,Soundcloud,5,8/11/2020 19:35,All I have to say is it’s way better than pandora
3450,Mobile,4,8/24/2020 12:33,We need mobile to have a description for music I feel like mobile is limited
3451,"Beautiful App, Thank you for giving your BEST! May all your days be truly blessed🙏🏽👍👍👍",5,7/30/2020 11:32,"Beautiful App, Thank you for giving your BEST! May all your days be truly blessed🙏🏽👍👍👍"

3453,Problems,2,7/15/2020 17:38,I’ve used soundcloud before but every time you try to get into it now it glitches and takes you right back to the home screen. Something needs to be fixed.
3454,Why I hate SoundCloud,2,7/5/2020 1:47,"One reason is that they made all the songs I like and made it so I have to buy SoundCloud go just to listen to it 😤
All I want is to listen to my favorite songs and now all my songs are now just previews of what they were"
3455,Something is wrong!,2,6/24/2020 2:20,"I have had this app for a very long time and something is wrong with it now. It’s says every song has to have that sound cloud plan. Like every song says that, all I can listen to is previews. Can I please get a fix?"
3456,SoundCloud,4,6/3/2020 21:10,I would read it five stars but I can’t listen to music off-line without buying premium and downloading the music
3457,Would recommend,4,5/27/2020 17:08,I like the app and also like that you can do something and play the music

3460,a little bad,3,4/10/2020 2:22,"i enjoy soundcloud for a lot of reasons, but this is the thing that pisses me off:
the music keeps stopping and the app keeps crashing.
i did the best i can to keep the music playing, but it keeps stopping. i restarted and rebooted my ipad, refreshed the app, refreshed everything, checked if everything was okay, but it kept on stopping. my storage has plenty of space and it keeps stopping. i would give a high review if this didn’t happen."

3470,Good music app.,5,7/5/2022 17:59,"It’s a pretty good music app, it has nice menus and UI, The searching is good and the subscription isn’t much. So 5 stars."
3471,ADS,1,7/27/2022 2:22,I used SoundCloud for about 3 years now I haven’t got that manny Ads then but now it’s a crap tone it’s so annoying I’m just trying to listen to music in peace with out the same advertisements over and over I’m deleting this app and never using it again

3473,I love SoundCloud but please fix these bugs!,1,6/26/2022 4:41,The new update interface doesn’t bother me at all but the constant glitching freezing and involuntary closing really grinds my gears as an artist who uploads pretty regularly to the platform please release an update soon to fix it thank you (:

3478,Pros/cons,3,4/12/2022 18:34,"Love the app, but I hate the frequent ads especially when u can’t skip them. If this continues or gets worse will look for alternative app"
3479,To many adds,2,3/20/2022 13:09,I used to love this app an used it for years up until now bc I finally got tired of listing to maybe if I’m lucky like 2 songs without adds then boom long adds
3480,Can’t cancel subscription,2,3/6/2022 17:53,"I have tried for two months to cancel a subscription. I get charged every month , but it is impossible to cancel. Otherwise a decent app"

3496,Ads bruh.,2,8/9/2021 16:01,Use to be my go to. Now you can’t skip a song without a 45 second ad. Or even just listening. It’s an ad being played after each song.

3509,Bad algorithm,1,2/28/2021 19:59,I’m tired of streaming music and the same song will literally play 3 times in a row and when I skip songs it would be nice to actually skip them without seeing the same song skip over and over
3510,✌️,4,2/22/2021 21:28,I love this app but the whole reason I wanted this app was so I could listen to it offline...other then that good music.
3511,No mobile messaging,2,2/22/2021 2:24,It’s 2021 and SoundCloud still doesn’t have mobile messaging and it won’t let you request desktop if you have a message link
3512,Love,5,2/15/2021 4:42,Can multitask on my iPad listening to soundcloud and use other apps simultaneously

3524,#1 app,5,10/18/2020 1:32,You know this world can be horrible but t least I have SoundCloud thanx guys!!!
3525,Bad customer service,1,10/30/2020 14:50,"Still getting charged 10$ a month when none of my accounts say they’re even subscribed to anything. Would really like to speak with someone about canceling whatever I’m getting charged, thanks."
3526,"House man, house man, house man!",5,8/18/2020 14:49,I’m a hip-hop head by nature however when I want that more exotic sound I can always count on the cloud to help me out.

3528,Kinda good as for me,5,8/17/2020 12:47,In my opinion SoundCloud is a rlly useful app for music-lovers ig. But this ads are killin me sometimes btw i want more original versions of songs fo free 😚
3529,I love the SoundCloud,5,8/16/2020 3:10,Its an amazing app ❤️ I really love List from it 💕 i wish you just make it for free because people in Sudan can’t by subscribe 🥺✌🏼

3533,No customer service!!,1,8/1/2020 6:41,"I paid $5.99 for what was advertised as a free 30 day trial. Apple took the money out of my bank account, but I never received the access to the app as advertised. Now this app is referring me back to Apple in order to cancel this useless app! What a crock of crap. I’ll just turn this into my bank for fraud!"
3534,It changed,1,7/29/2020 2:32,Now SoundCloud you have to have SoundCloud go+ and it’s so dumb I enjoyed being able to listen to the music that I enjoyed for free cause not everyone can spend money on getting music and it really needs to change back because I used to love it now I hate it please change it back
3535,Awesome,5,7/15/2020 22:15,I love being able to listen to music from all over. Gets me moving.

3538,Premium needs to be cheaper,4,7/7/2020 16:58,"Bro, I am not gonna spend $13 just so I can get premium music, and the $6 plan is pretty useless, other than that, great app. Would recommend if you listen to LiL PEEP or LiL UZI VERT!"

3580,Quick and easy,5,11/18/2021 9:02,"All I do is press on the app, press play then I’m in my zone!"
3581,Poor ad implementation,2,11/22/2021 19:49,"I don’t mind the frequency of ads, as much as the fact that video ads refuse to even play if you leave the app to do something while you listen, and are hugely disruptive."
3582,It’s just amazing for people trying to blow up,5,10/30/2021 14:58,This is the best platform and the community it is astonishing.
3583,ha,3,11/6/2021 18:33,"well in the new update they said they fixed bugs but i can’t even listen to my music anymore so, I wonder what’s going on hmmm?  Is it a bug perhaps"

3597,Bad thing abt SoundCloud,2,7/3/2021 15:42,You guys should put ads but let the music play over it because it's aggravating having to wait 30 secs to let the next song play all the time
3598,SoundCloud,5,6/15/2021 17:23,Just please please stay free don’t turn your back on us

3622,Music for people who get tired of the mainstream,5,12/22/2020 22:20,Love what SoundCloud has to offer.
3623,It’s Littttyt,4,12/23/2020 21:15,It is an awesome app don’t get me wrong but there are many adds and if you get a new phone all it music goes alway so this is my rate
3624,Music,5,12/18/2020 5:56,Soundcloud is a good streaming all especially for unreleased music. I recommend.
3625,Good except one annoying thing,2,12/19/2020 23:41,"For me, scrolling in all my playlists is extremely choppy and laggy. Not smooth scrolling like every other modern music app. Running latest iOS on 8 Plus"
3626,Good updated,5,11/26/2020 22:05,New music is always there ! Ready !
3627,I cannot download it,1,12/17/2020 21:54,So my phone just restarted and then it wasn’t updating so I decided to reinstall it but after I deleted this app I tried to find it on app store but couldn’t can anyone help me related to this I’m using an usa region apple id but still its not showing on app store
3628,Mateocrystalofficial,5,11/15/2020 16:49,I love this app if you want to distribute your music then I recommend it
3629,🔥,3,11/18/2020 2:27,It’s honestly a very good app but I really wish their was like a way I could listen to more classic or like old music without it being for SoundCloud plus

3634,Used to Be Great,1,10/18/2020 3:27,"I used to love SoundCloud but the free version is absolutely unbearable with all the adds. You hear more adds than music and some are even in different languages, overall it’s unbearable unless you upgrade and even then I don’t think it’s worth it."
3635,Rain snow,4,10/17/2020 15:25,I love the app but I hate all the cussing in the comments and the “add my Snapchat for my dirty pics” please make a way to remove the comments
3636,This is awesome,4,9/12/2020 13:55,This SoundCloud is awesome but I have one problem the songs I was looking for it will not give me the original

3642,Soundcloud ads,3,7/27/2020 15:34,Can you make a update to SoundCloud to make less ads because I keep getting a ad basically every time I change a song
3643,Good backup for Apple Music,5,7/4/2020 18:28,I like that you can listen to any song without any restrictions
3644,Great app but,4,7/22/2020 4:40,I love soundcloud i just want to be able to add more bass or less i just want to be able the change that stuff
3645,Needs just one thing,4,7/6/2020 17:03,Would be the best if you guys focused on rotating song on profiles with less then 300 followers... random highlights of random artist
3646,Glitchy,3,7/5/2020 14:40,SoundCloud will always be my first choice for music. But.... For the love of god please fix the glitch that blocks new music from coming on to the stream page for days at a time.
3647,Connections,5,6/15/2020 12:47,"I’m hundreds of miles away from my kid but his new tunes are right here. Thanks for taking me home, Sound Cloud."
3648,It don’t work,3,6/25/2020 14:22,It would have been 5 but one day out of know where all the songs on my playlist said it was go but they never were

3650,SoundCloud’s the only way to go,5,6/13/2020 7:36,Besides the ads this is the only music app I actually like
3651,Awesome,5,6/9/2020 15:29,"I love sound cloud. Well organized, easy to use, great music, user friendly. Killer software guys really appreciate it!"

3659,Stop having the same add,4,4/14/2020 22:33,The app is really great with music it is just that same add and have a remix to a lot of the songs the only add you here is about vaping
3660,KenTer,5,4/1/2020 17:56,I love having a place to listen to my talented loved one’s new inspirations. I love that I can also listen to the work of independent artists.

3665,Downloading playlists offline,4,3/21/2020 22:04,Good app and everything but I HAVE too download ALL MY PLAYLISTS OVER AND OVER. They don’t stay downloaded for offline listening. Please fix this.
3666,Messages?,4,3/14/2020 19:16,"Soundcloud is great, but some improvements can be made. Please make messages available on mobile!"

3669,Soundcloud forever,5,2/10/2020 23:38,"Grew up with SoundCloud, never changing up even though I’m too broke to afford it 😂"
3670,Music,2,2/11/2020 12:10,You know I would listen to my fav songs everyday but now since SoundCloud decided to make every song I listen to the Go+ and now I hate it. I think it’s stupid how they did that! It made me so mad bec every song I liked I can’t listen to now!
3671,SoundCloud,5,2/3/2020 15:49,It is such a great app! Love how easy you can listen to podcasts! Gonna try it for music next!

3679,Great for lesser known artists,4,8/20/2022 12:15,I like that I can find lesser known artists through this app but I don’t find it easy to navigate.

3681,ADS.,1,7/9/2022 21:51,dude you can’t skip two songs without 30 second ad you can’t skip and any good some is limited to premium ontop of that sometimes they’re double 30 second ads in the end it’s more ads then music

Now fix this app forreal."
3722,Five stars,5,12/26/2020 22:17,Everything works as i should 👍👍
3723,Best app for up coming artist,5,12/17/2020 22:43,Sound cloud is a great way to gain exposure due to its consistent fan base of discovering talented artist and promote there music
3724,The app keeps glitching,2,12/18/2020 1:26,I’ve updated the app and everything but it’s running pretty slowly and it has a lot of glitches. It’s weird and I’m not sure if anyone else has this issue.
3725,Works for me!,5,12/6/2020 2:45,Used to upload links to FB
3726,"Beautiful, But...",3,12/2/2020 8:22,"Please, I keep getting old spice Christmas ads every. single. time. And it just turns into static after the fist five seconds and then it’s just... static for a solid fifteen seconds. 😭"
3727,Awesome app!!!!,5,11/6/2020 15:53,This app is the BEST!!! I could hear music with our wasting battery and is super awesome that is why I give it  5 STARS
3728,Very disappointed,1,11/30/2020 7:45,I will give it 0 stars if I can because there are 2 ads after each song. The ads are longer than the actual song. Very disappointing. Just uninstalled it
3729,Good,5,10/14/2020 22:55,This app is good to listen to music and do other stuff I give it 5 stars
3730,Missing key feature,1,10/27/2020 22:22,The ‘Get info’ button was removed/ never included/ not available. Why go out of your way to remove an important feature artists use to express or communicate with their listeners.
3731,soundCloud,5,8/29/2020 22:31,I love the app I post music up there but for some reason I don’t get an of you but I mean I live in that it is great
3732,Why no info section!?,3,9/10/2020 17:19,Why do I have to go to the desktop site to check info and track list!
3733,This app is amazing!,5,7/21/2020 14:20,If there is music ur looking for you will most likely find it here it’s like spodify but better!!😄
3734,RIP all my favorite songs,1,8/2/2020 17:01,I used to listen to a huge playlist with all of my favorite songs at night and recently SoundCloud decided to put the 30 second preview thingy on almost every song in it. Now I can’t listen to my favorite songs because of that.
3735,I prefer it over other music apps,5,7/13/2020 23:26,I like the layout and my favorite artist are on here
3736,Ads,2,7/16/2020 3:09,"Please lower the ad count or get rid of those ads with drills already, its annoying when i have music playing and “this is a bone drill” followed by the sound of a very loud and annoying drill, same with almost all real cost ads"
3737,5 Star,5,7/1/2020 3:54,Good but a lot off ads but every song or artist u could want is in here
3738,Ads,3,7/13/2020 5:58,I love soundcloud because it’s the only app that has all the music I like but there are WAYYY too many ads. There are two ads after only a couple songs. Just ruins it.
3739,.,4,7/1/2020 11:45,"Its such a great app, Im still using it from ever, but will be better if you add “play next” and “play last” buttons."
3740,In love,5,5/23/2020 7:21,I love this app so much I use it every where I go an you can even upload your own music!!😊
3741,Too many ads,3,6/9/2020 3:28,I listen to one song then the next is and advertisement then I listen to another song another advertisement 😭 it’s irritating
3742,Great Way to Check out Music,5,5/15/2020 22:37,Love the access to artists and how it branches everything out. Great stuff.
3743,Update needed,2,5/20/2020 0:56,"This app was great but lately its been glitching out, the app would close out on its own and restart & I know for a fact nothing is wrong with my phone because this is the only app that glitches and bugs out"
3744,Sound cloud,5,5/10/2020 17:41,This app is amazing I’ve been using it for years and I love it it’s perfect for on the go music
3745,Something isn’t right,4,5/6/2020 13:06,Random songs pop up and not in order how it is something’s wrong..
3746,Issue,1,5/8/2020 22:40,"When next song supposed to play , it bounces far away from that song and plays another song then after that song it brings different music from unknown artist like if it was a radio 😤😤😤 it barely started doing that yesterday on 5/7/20"
3747,All rap,5,5/4/2020 22:29,It has almost everything
3748,I love SoundCloud,5,5/3/2020 6:46,Bro I just got to say this app is so good and I love SoundCloud and yes the ads got annoying bet then I realized that it was to support the artist but thanks SoundCloud makers .
3749,SoundCloud,5,4/30/2020 2:09,I keep buffering out of the app I think something’s wrong with it
3750,Great place to discover music,5,4/18/2020 7:52,Love the mobile app to find new music and connect
3751,The songs,3,4/26/2020 13:28,Soundcloud is a great app and the playlists are amazing but every time I try to play a song it changes it to the next song randomly
3752,SoundCloud,5,4/17/2020 5:54,I like the SoundCloud and I want to change the profile account.
3753,Fire!,5,2/19/2020 23:26,"Awesome app, any music you can’t find anywhere else you can find it here"
3754,It was great until...,1,4/8/2020 13:45,So I used to got SoundCloud for all my music but then recently they made almost every big artists songs SoundCloud plus and so I’m going to find a different app because I do not want to pay just to listen to music if they would fix this I would come back...
3755,I like it,4,4/1/2020 16:22,I love the app and music i can also meet new musicians i think they should get rid of the adds because the interrupt the music
3756,Charged for no reason,1,3/11/2020 16:05,I don’t even use SoundCloud and my account was charged $9.99.  I checked it out a month or so ago for a specific artist.  I can’t even find where my card info is on my account.  I looked at the go plus and it’s a charge of $5.99 so why in the world am I being charged $9.99?!!!
3757,Amazing music app!!,5,2/19/2020 5:58,I love it!! Only 2 ads and always 30 seconds you can play any song on demand!

3761,I USED to like this app,1,1/19/2020 21:36,I have had soundcloud since i got my phone. It was never really giving me problems until now. At least 97% of the songs in my playlist have GO+ and i didnt have to pay for those before. Im really annoyed and hope that they can fix it.
3762,Really good,5,8/25/2022 0:16,"This app is really good but it lag me a lot ,but its still a good app that you dont need to pay."

3770,Description of track info?!,2,5/11/2022 21:59,"AFTER ALL THESE YEARS..WHY IS THERE STILL NO DESCRIPTION TAB FOR IPHONE USERS?!?!

3774,This app kinda mids,1,3/2/2022 19:18,Will change this review when y’all put the queue feature back in… makes no sense why y’all would remove that with no other alternative and also y’all should pay your artists more.
3775,It was good until the recent update,2,2/26/2022 18:38,All my liked tracks have to be re downloaded every time I open the app and the app crashes randomly too. Please fix ASAP !!!
3776,I mean... come on.,5,1/14/2022 1:01,"It's SoundCloud!

Wide, diverse cast of songs, with only the copyright claimed songs behind the premium subscription!

Play music while the app or even THE PHONE is closed!

Loop function... need I say more?

Plus that beautiful crackhead comment energy that SoundCloud is infamous for!

Only downside?
Bots.

That's about it.

SOUNDCLOUD FOREVER!!!"

3823,To SoundCloud,3,8/12/2020 17:16,It’s a good app for music it’s just annoying that songs that weren’t SoundCloud Go+ are now that it’s frustrating cause that’s what I use for music every day and when I  am traveling.
3824,Sounds cloud,4,8/5/2020 16:05,Hey SoundCloud I actully have a question so sometimes my soundcloud goes to all SoundCloud go is that just my soundcloud glitching or are you guys making SoundCloud all go
3825,"Great app, but missing some features",4,7/23/2020 17:40,"I love this app but it could really use a couple features

- up next / queueing 
- playlist organization
- when in the stream tab, a way to jump to your currently playing song. 

I got premium because I love this service, but I wish there were features present on the web version."

3851,My Library,2,2/21/2020 21:52,Every time when I open the app and go to my library it freezes or gets stuck and I have to close the app and re open it please update or fix this please I would very much appreciate it.🙏🏿
3852,SoundCloud,5,2/8/2020 19:37,It fire bc they got all my song I listen so u better give these a 5 stars
3853,Soundcloud,5,1/5/2020 15:43,Very good and has all the songs you can think of.
3854,Not the quality of music but the volume,2,1/14/2020 5:15,"I love that I can use this while using other apps, but it’s to loud or to much bass for some songs. Hope you can get this fixed. Really love that I can use SoundCloud now with other apps."
3855,I don’t recommend this app,1,1/13/2020 12:21,Okay so like I’ve been listening to SoundCloud for a LONG time and I’ve always loved it till recently. It’s literally all ADs about vaping or you have to PAY for almost every GOOD song and it’s super annoying. Definitely to the point to where I don’t recommend this app.
3856,It’s great,4,1/6/2020 20:50,It is a great app but it has too many ads and SoundCloud go or plus is to might be too expensive for some people
3857,Amazing app,5,1/4/2020 22:51,"This is definitely my favorite app for music since you can listen to all the best artists like X, Lil loaded, and Ski. It’s just great."
3858,Needs thumbs down button,2,1/3/2020 19:22,For people in terms of posting bad content on purpose on SoundCloud there needs to be a thumbs down and if it reaches enough bad rep then the content can be hidden from trending or a report button could be nice for the app
3859,Good platform,4,9/5/2022 16:47,It’s really good for if you wanna make income from it but it has bugs every now and then
3860,Love this app,5,7/26/2022 10:44,Been using SoundCloud for over a decade. A necessity if you’re a self made music creator

3862,Errors on errors,1,7/26/2022 15:32,"After multiple attempts to sign up, I kept getting server errors. Tried different ways to sign up, eventually was told my sign up was spam. Attempted to contact support, more run around. Not trying a 4th time."

3866,The update broke it,1,6/13/2022 14:50,"It loads songs I already had saved but I can’t search any, and it’s a lot slower now after the update.

This might be nitpicky but I also don’t like how the update looks, please go back to what it looked like before."
3867,Too many ads,1,6/3/2022 19:40,"Getting very greedy with ads lately. After one song, ad. Then after two more songs two thrirty second unskippable ads. Will be looking for new music platform."

3869,I love it,5,5/17/2022 19:50,"It’s an amazing app to listen to all you favorite songs rap,pop,country,r&b and more!!!"
3870,Riddled with ads.,1,5/19/2022 4:56,"There is an ad every other song, if you are on a short car ride but want to play a song, do not use SoundCloud, because you will get two 30 second ads for a 1:30 song."

3889,App Use Restrictive Ads,1,3/22/2021 17:30,"Once an ad plays you can’t do anything in the app until it ends. That means no profile screen, next music selection, Nothing! Until this “feature” is removed the app is staying 1 star."
3890,More ads then music,2,3/14/2021 21:03,I’m tired of opening this app and being flooded with ads. Not just one ad but multiple ones right after the other
3891,So glitchy,3,2/27/2021 18:06,I love this app I’ve been using it for years but some reason it had new bugs and it’s so laggy so can talk please fix that
3892,Great App,5,1/29/2021 3:16,It is always one of the first apps I install on a new device

3901,New version crashes,3,12/9/2020 20:31,Hey guys! New latest version of app to this date is force quitting every 10 mins on background.
3902,🥺,3,12/7/2020 5:25,Why is it when scroll for music it lags so much & it chooses music on it own when I’m scrolling 🥺 SoundCloud wasn’t like that before back in 2019
3903,Best music mixes ever,5,10/17/2020 22:07,I love this app I can’t workout with anything else
3904,👌,4,11/22/2020 21:02,It’s a good app 🤷 the ads are quite long and annoying but other wise it’s pretty okay.
3905,SoundCloud,3,11/19/2020 22:35,“Great app but way tooo much ads and most you can’t skip at all” Since I posted this a few days ago the ads have triple for I rate it 3 stars 👎🏿
3906,Update,4,11/19/2020 15:14,Can there be a update including deleting/hiding a song off radios and playlists.....?
3907,A lot of ads!,1,10/19/2020 2:26,After every 2/3 songs you have to watch a 30-60 second add witch the music is good and I’m glad you can close your phone well you are listening to music but you have to listen to a lot of adds
3908,Ads,5,10/2/2020 15:17,The ads don’t make it any better :/
3909,Good app,3,10/2/2020 17:41,Very great app to discover new music and new artists but the app does run a lil slow and laggy at time hopefully you guys could fix the apps small bugs
3910,Best place to find songs not everyone has~,5,8/26/2020 7:16,I was going thru a heartbreak~ Now it helps me cope.
3911,Request,4,9/17/2020 9:07,Can you make it available as  widgets in ios 14
3912,Good but to many ads to bother with,3,9/14/2020 19:03,Nice app if they can only make it easier to form playlist and cut out the ads to a minimum
3913,Good,4,9/11/2020 22:28,The app is great. The only problem for me is that you can’t loop a playlist like on the website
3914,I love sc,3,9/8/2020 6:23,"I love SoundCloud, but 
I swear sometimes this app plays app every other song sometimes, it's annoying. It's honestly all the Go $10 a month is worth."
3915,Fw it heavy,5,7/29/2020 16:28,"it’s great, been using for years id recommend getting the full version🐐🔌"
3916,Add speed control,4,8/15/2020 4:49,"I would love for them to add a speed control option, so I can listen to podcast at a faster rate"
3917,A good music app but,3,8/9/2020 4:13,It is good and all but it makes me pay for the song I’m trying to listen to and everything else is a remix and it is just a pain to deal with
3918,5 Stars,5,7/21/2020 17:58,Great app for music. Excellent music platform to release your music and find some new music.
3919,Help,4,7/16/2020 20:04,Lately my soundclouf has been acting weird it will play the song for a sec and them stop and kick me out the app
3920,Don’t argue just get it,5,7/14/2020 14:18,Great so far . All it need is a better way of customer service
3921,My story,5,7/6/2020 17:44,Soundcloud is gud except when the premium thing u have to buy
3922,Why?,1,7/12/2020 23:33,I understand corona virus probably making this app hard to run but tbh there are so many other music apps I would spend my money on that isn’t this app. You should’ve left the music in there off free I will be taking my money to Apple Music now with everyone else.
3923,Hate this app now,1,7/7/2020 17:51,I’ve had SoundCloud for years and it’s been my life line when I was depressed or suicidal and now all of a sudden you wanna charge for almost every song??? That’s ridiculous and outrageous. I don’t have the money to be paying for Go+ I’ve got bills and a child to feed.
3924,I’m only doing this so stop asking,5,7/4/2020 10:27,It’s a great app just stop asking me to rating it.
3925,The only form of underground rap we have!,5,6/14/2020 17:44,SoundCloud plays a major part of us independent artist getting our voices heard. #Shelah
3926,Really?,5,6/7/2020 1:51,To all the people advertising !!! when I hear your advertise in the middle musics I love I just start hate you !! Ok!???
3927,"Great app, but sabotaging themselves.",2,6/9/2020 15:32,"I’ve used this app for years, but the implementation of the “free monthly listening  limit” on music is absurd. Soundcloud was my go to music streaming platform for years, but unfortunately this has driven me away to other platforms."
3928,Broken,1,6/7/2020 20:29,"Fix your app it kicks me out and also it won’t play music and I’m connected to the internet, even tried my data which I have unlimited and it didn’t work I also paid for SoundCloud plus or whatever it’s called and I can’t even use the app, why?"
3929,Very Pleased!,5,6/6/2020 12:34,Soundcloud is useful for finding work of local performers & updating your music collection!
3930,Great,5,6/5/2020 13:59,This is the best with internet but I wish the made go+ less expensive

3932,Amazing,5,5/6/2020 20:34,This app is really good it has every music and songs you can imagine.
3933,Too Greedy,2,5/15/2020 4:13,Soundcloud is a great app. But the developers just want cash. They make almost every good song for Premium users only. They just want people to buy Premium to get money and its really annoying. Im using a new app for music from now on.
3934,a bug,4,5/6/2020 23:32,"I like SoundCloud a lot free music, who wouldn’t, but every time I try to open the app it crashes and closes"

3939,Glitches,3,3/8/2020 23:30,Everytime I try to add a song to a playlist it will glitch and try to make a whole new playlist and won’t stop doing that.
3940,Luv it,5,2/20/2020 11:32,"Luv the app, my song was reposted by another account, I got a couple more views. Very useful for promoting your tracks!"

3944,"Daily Wire: Shapiro, Klavan, Knowles, Walsh",5,1/15/2020 4:33,Like the large easy to use running sliding band that allows location/access to any portion of broadcast instantaneously and repetitively.

3951,Deleted,1,7/12/2022 15:37,I’ve had this free app SoundCloud for many years never had a problem with it. Yes ads here and there but now I’m forced to pay monthly fees. Out of nowhere I can’t play my playlist. Yea definitely will no longer be using SoundCloud.

3958,Wouldn’t play music,1,6/13/2022 15:56,"I updated the app a couple minutes ago and tried to play some music right after reopening the app.
None of the tabs would load and music wouldn’t play.
I tried playing music on both wifi and cellular data.
I tried several different songs from different albums and artists and playlists with nothing working.

I’ve been using SoundCloud for a while now and I really like it. I hope this gets fixed"
3959,too many ads,3,6/10/2022 18:59,It’s literally 2 ads after every 1 song. Its ridiculous

4012,New update is terrible,1,10/30/2020 5:06,"After the new update where SoundCloud went back to pay for no ads, the app has gone terribly downhill. You can’t even play the ads in the background, you have to be in the app."
4013,Great App!!,5,10/19/2020 14:46,Its a great app! I always go to here if I need to listen to music anywhere and at anytime!!

4015,Rate,5,8/24/2020 3:52,I love this app this is the only app I use to listen to my music I love it I don’t use even thing else ❤️
4016,An opinion??,4,10/11/2020 21:15,I think you guys should improve your app by adding an equalizer for people that enjoy bass in their music.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
4017,Epic fail,1,10/1/2020 5:55,"So, I’ve purchased a subscription to soundcloud. And the past 2 days, I’ve not been able to play “any” of the music I’ve downloaded! It’s lagging all the time. Only reason I stared paying, was so I can listen to my music offline 🙄 fix this..."
4018,My review,2,9/12/2020 16:23,I hate the app why when we upload audios or music we have to updoad it with files i hate that and why can’t I be camera roll it won’t let me import it from the files
4019,Good app,3,9/5/2020 12:55,I love SoundCloud I’ve been using it for ever but when I’m scrolling through my playlist it’s very laggy and I wish you could male a playlist with more than 499 songs
4020,This app is good to find music,5,7/31/2020 18:17,I like to hear songs that I don’t even know and I like it 🔥🔥
4021,Too many ads,3,8/14/2020 4:33,Great app but ads get really annoying they try to force you to buy a membership to block the ads
4022,Take the commercials out,5,7/21/2020 14:51,Take the commercials out
4023,HELP,2,7/31/2020 2:33,"So recently I was gonna put some music on SoundCloud, I was signed out on there so I signed back in all of my likes and playlist were Gone like complete gone But my playlists were still on there but it isn’t can someone help me"
4024,Awesome Music App!,5,7/14/2020 10:40,I listen to sound cloud regularly and I highly recommend the music app.
4025,WHERE IS THE QUEUE ON THE APP CMON,3,7/18/2020 4:54,ADD A QUEUE this can’t be that difficult of a feature yet i’ve been waiting for it for like 3 years..listen to soundcloud for most of my music but will probably switch if there’s no queue still
4026,Great app to discover new things!,5,6/26/2020 18:31,I love SoundCloud and enjoy experiencing new music and things like meditations. Thank you SoundCloud!
4027,Great!,5,6/25/2020 1:05,Great app to be honest. A lot of big time known rappers came from the bottom starting here! Gray way to become a rapper/singer. Good place to start.!
4028,Five stars,5,5/26/2020 19:26,Five stars because they have every sing a song
4029,Good for finding more underground rappers/artists!,4,6/1/2020 13:08,I personally use SoundCloud but the amount of unreleased songs and smaller rappers on here is what keeps me coming back.
4030,SO. MANY. ADS.,1,5/29/2020 15:02,After every single song. Ad after ad after ad after ad. Theres more listening time devoted to ads than to music on an app that is supposed to be about supporting artist’s music. This app gives more airtime to companies and whatever product they offer.
4031,Soundcloud thumbs up,5,5/16/2020 19:00,"Wonderful app
For discovery, 
 for sharing
Hope to get more space and host a ton more"
4032,Took away record ability,1,5/22/2020 17:11,Took away the ability to record and introduced ads. This app is now totally useless to me. I will be switching to another service and abandoning this one until and unless those issues are rectified.
4033,Amazing,4,5/20/2020 21:34,Great app use it every day the only downside is that I can’t use it on my watch it would be amazing if they added that.
4034,I absolutely love this app,5,5/12/2020 19:10,So many underground songs can be found here
4035,No problems,5,4/13/2020 23:05,Works with my needs
4036,Dr safari,4,5/11/2020 1:00,Slow to upload songs.  Need to do it many times.  And can’t figure out how to latch my SoundCloud to instagram.....
4037,Free songs?,2,4/23/2020 14:59,This is a free app where you can listen to songs for free. But over the last few weeks I’ve been getting you have to purchase the sound cloud go premium which doesn’t make sense.
4038,Music,4,4/21/2020 15:52,Love the app just don’t like when it automatically skips songs when you don’t want to yet it’s a good app.
4039,I love this app,5,4/2/2020 20:45,This app has most of my favorite songs it’s the best I really recommend this app this is so good
4040,Ads everywhere now,2,4/4/2020 17:25,I love this and app but ads are coming more frequently. I don’t mind ads but anything more then 10 seconds is a long time when it comes to music. 15-60s advertisements can really ruin a vibe
4041,It good,5,3/26/2020 6:34,I like it lots of song you wouldn’t find on other apps
4042,Apples,5,3/19/2020 12:25,I think apples to apples is a fun card game!i enjoy hanging out and listening to bob marley:) Also Jeffery Eipstein didn’t kill himself
4043,Saves a lot of time.,5,3/11/2020 19:04,Get what are looking for quickly.
4044,Amazing!,5,3/5/2020 6:33,I absolutely love this app and I can listen to my favorite songs without any disturbance!
4045,Music is my life,4,3/7/2020 12:37,My only complaint is some songs are not complete
4046,Good app,5,2/26/2020 12:49,Just starting using this app to listen to the Converge Coaching podcast. It was easy to find and easy to operate.
4047,TRY GO+,1,3/3/2020 16:12,I got this app Bc it was free to listen to music and now half my playlist I’m no longer able to listen to Bc it’s all Go+ now when just the other day like yesterday🤦🏽‍♂️I was able to listen to the whole song highly dislike it and already deleted the app
4048,I love it,5,2/21/2020 3:40,"You may not get all songs free, but this app is amazing!!! Definitely worth trying"
4049,Too slow,2,2/24/2020 23:16,"Couldn’t be laggier to scroll through liked tracks/stream. If I scroll fast I have to wait about 5 seconds for each scroll to complete. 

Also, what music app doesn’t have Queue/Add to up next in 2020?"
4050,Not a problem,5,2/3/2020 4:46,It is not a bad music app overall
4051,I love SoundCloud but,4,2/14/2020 15:56,They new issue I am dealing with is I can’t go to my playlist without the app crashing so if you know how to fix it pls tell me
4052,Sound cloud,5,1/27/2020 20:39,I just love they have like every song in the world
4053,Audio copy feature= STEALING!!!,1,2/1/2020 22:19,I'm a hard working musician. I cannot believe your app connects to audiocopy. You're making it that much easier for people to steal music. How are we supposed to pay our bills when it's do easy for people to rip us off?? You're part of the problem.
4054,Fire,5,1/15/2020 0:53,"Best app to get if you want to hear some good sometimes, most of the times free song."
4055,Sound cloud,5,1/6/2020 1:40,Probably the best site to find raw music that you can relate to of all genres
4056,Change the preview songs to free,3,1/2/2020 20:17,Oh no you did not just change the songs that I LISTEN TO PREVIEW. Change that back cause like now I’m bouta delete this app since I gotta pay.😭
4057,Rating,4,1/1/2020 22:42,"decent, doesn’t have all real music but it’s good alternative if your other music isn’t working!!"
4058,Thanks SoundCloud!!!,5,9/6/2022 16:42,(A) must-use tool for all artists/creative people and listeners\appreciators of that stuff.

4060,Shuffle For Playlist,3,8/13/2022 17:10,Y’all should add a shuffle button for the playlist. So I don’t have pick and choose a lot of my songs.
4061,A lot of ads,2,8/19/2022 2:57,Been slowly incorporating more and more ads. Nearly one every other song played. Very annoying. Didn’t used to be like this
4062,Love long house mixes on SoundCloud,5,7/4/2022 1:54,Great app. Love SoundCloud for easy on the go music. Especially long mixtapes.
4063,App freezes & too many ads,1,8/7/2022 17:34,"While songs are playing it freezes to where I can’t navigate to other songs, and ads play after 3-4 songs very frustrating"
4064,Great for posting music and listening!,4,7/20/2022 2:07,"I enjoy this app, but the compression can be frustrating!"
4065,Sound cloud,5,5/30/2022 20:30,Sound cloud is go good help to clean and others
4066,New update needs a fix,2,6/13/2022 17:30,"I can’t even listen to songs or really go to any tabs on SoundCloud without reaching a notice saying, try again and error"
4067,I like the song in it,5,5/29/2022 0:45,I love the song and some I never heard of and I love it

4106,Ads after basically every song,1,11/13/2020 15:41,"Long ads play after every song , sometimes 2 ads , and the ads couldn’t be more annoying"

4111,I used to love soundcloud,1,8/18/2020 5:43,The amount of Ads are ridiculous. They’re so annoying and unnecessary. Can’t even skip or choose a song with an ad popping up. Sometimes it glitches or freezes while changing a song and skips to an ad.
4112,Way too many ads,2,8/3/2020 16:49,"Every time I try to listen to music, there’s a 15 second unskippable ad or a 30 second ad. It’s really annoying. You guys need to fix this."

4114,Pretty good,3,7/6/2020 16:44,I would have rated it 5 but it’s no longer letting me like songs.  Out of nowhere it stopped letting me like songs.  If I like a song it instantly unlikes it. Can anyone help fix this?
4115,SoundCloud is amazing,5,6/29/2020 2:32,"This app is amazing, it has my favorite artist Juice WRLD’s unreleased music, I’m actually listening to it while typing this!"
4116,REMOVE TRUTH ORANGE ADS,4,7/1/2020 16:47,Seriously these ads scare me so bad when it’s 3am and I’m just trying to vibe. I don’t rly mind their message but stop using monsters and all these scary sounds pls it’s honestly ruining SoundCloud
4117,Up next????,4,6/30/2020 3:25,Add an up next selection. Adding songs to a queue list would be even better...

4120,its pretty good,4,6/21/2020 18:37,ive been using soundcloud for like 4 years and no complaints. i give it a 4 out of 5 cuz recently it didn’t allow me to listen to like 95% of my music unless i upgraded to soundcloud go+. so what i did to bypass this is created a new account and now i can listen to my old songs again.

Every time I open the app it freezes on me for more than 30 seconds then it closes of the app!! A lot more than once. And I’ve been paying for the full subscription for over 2 years! FIX THIS!!!!!

4147,Not worth it,1,9/2/2022 1:17,This app isn’t worth it because when you update it the app will glitch out and make you have to delete your playlist just to listen to music this was a waste of my time.
4148,Best music,4,8/30/2022 19:18,Best place to find good new EDM music. Wish the interface were more intuitive to use.
4149,Can’t Search Like Before,1,8/26/2022 1:34,I’m not able to search as in the past. Artists I have listened for years. Can you please update the search feature. It use to be free but now seems like we have to pay idk

4171,keeps logging me out!!,1,10/26/2021 16:18,i keep trying to create a new account and every time it logs me out of the account a couple minutes later and acts like i never created the account. So there’s basically no way for me to use the app

4173,Great selection! Love it! Highly recommend,5,8/12/2021 2:50,A must for any music lover!
4174,musical bliss,5,8/2/2021 0:27,"soundcloud is honestly one of my favorite apps. it has ads but around every five, six songs. i think my favorite part is its ideal for any song and you can always create a playlist or save any song you like!"
4175,Good and useful,5,7/16/2021 16:45,All new music for free just I lik bit of ads rarely
4176,Unreliable,2,7/21/2021 15:07,I have used SoundCloud for years and while listening to music the app constantly crashes.   Over and over again.  It’s inconsistent.
4177,Great App,5,7/8/2021 3:39,"If you want to find future legends on the way up, go to SoundCloud!"
4178,Amazing!!! All the music I need!!! SO underrated,5,6/15/2021 14:24,"So much music I love, in one tiny app I wish the best for this amazing app."
4179,Glitching,2,7/3/2021 7:39,"Hello Souncloud! I have a complaint your app is glitching, has my music stopping at random times(not ads), and for some reason it keeps asking me to reload even though I have plent of times."
4180,Info of tracks,4,6/27/2021 6:26,Why I can’t see info of tracks in iOS version?
4181,It is what it is,5,5/21/2021 3:49,"And they make no more of what it is than what it is, pure music"
4182,Difficult navigation,3,5/25/2021 18:08,Not intuitive
4183,Sound cloud,5,5/12/2021 5:52,Great launch pad for all artists
4184,Give us the things on pc,3,5/3/2021 4:36,Give us the option to message people on the app like on the pc version of SoundCloud
4185,Good af,5,4/15/2021 0:11,Nice and you can use different apps at the same time
4186,SoundCloud,3,4/19/2021 23:00,This app lost half of my repost and also wont let me scroll done last 10 songs
4187,Music,5,4/9/2021 2:17,Sound cloud has a lot of music artists like liltj
4188,Your moms pods,5,4/1/2021 17:08,Don’t use any other music platform
4189,The best,5,3/2/2021 2:22,"One of the best music app that i have ever tried, free music, no adds it’s just perfect"
4190,Downgrade,3,3/26/2021 3:07,"I love this app, but recently I’ve been getting even more bugs since the update about a week ago"
4191,Sound Cloud,4,3/23/2021 2:44,Good medical information not found else where
4192,Horrible.(03/21),1,3/11/2021 1:49,Awful interface and incredibly laggy. Lag has been constant for almost a year now and hasn’t been fixed. Descriptions have still been removed which is VERY unhelpful. Why are they now a PC only feature???
4193,Cancel subscription,1,3/3/2021 16:07,They do not make it is to find where you can cancel the subscription. It is also difficult to speak with customer service or any person.
4194,Firm believer,5,2/26/2021 5:07,I believe full heartedly that sound cloud is my all time favorite music platform! 🙏🏼😍😎🥳
4195,Yuh,5,1/27/2021 17:38,I like it a lot it is good to have when you need to zone out
4196,Newest Update,2,2/7/2021 19:49,"After the new update, SoundCloud is still crashing. I’m paying money for it to be perfect, not to listen to half the song. Please fix it."
4197,It has trippie songs,5,1/24/2021 20:47,It has trippie songs
4198,Honest review,5,1/6/2021 12:48,I always thought dis app was overrated but I recently used it I LOVE IT!!! There is so many types of music slowed and reverb are my fav - bi💖💜💙
4199,Good app,5,11/12/2020 21:37,I love this app so much better than pandora
4200,Sad,2,1/4/2021 18:40,One of the only music apps i use is no longer usable on my Iphone 6. It says it requires ios 13 when my phone does not get it. Is there a workaround or anything?
4201,Vibe Killer,1,11/23/2020 21:27,Soundcloud is ridiculous now and just take advantage of free users. It’s pretty crazy how i’m getting 2 ads every 1-2 songs & the ads on here are 30 sec each and unskippable:/ already straying away from soundcloud to better apps.
4202,Awesome,5,11/10/2020 23:50,Pretty much one of the bust song listening apps
4203,Sound cloud opinion,5,11/9/2020 0:24,So good to use but I want to post on it cam you help???
4204,Fantastic Music app,5,11/8/2020 20:19,Amazing music app to start your gathering or family party
4205,Best music app,5,10/30/2020 19:48,Not that many ads audio is good plus the creation aspect to it
4206,Laggy Ad infested app,1,11/2/2020 1:43,"Can't scroll through my liked songs without the app stuttering and lagging and when I do play a song a 30 second ad about something irrelevant has a 99.9% chance of popping up, used to be a great app."
4207,Good app,5,10/20/2020 2:56,It is really nice for starter rappers but it should have a tutorial how to post music and make beats but it is fire 🔥🔥
4208,Not uploading a track,1,10/22/2020 23:27,I’ve been trying to upload a song today 3 times and it uploads it but once I refresh it it’s gone. I hope it’s a bug and not anything wrong with my phone
4209,My review,5,8/31/2020 0:51,Best app ever and the fact that i can chrome cast too is even better
4210,Eeee,5,8/16/2020 4:46,I love this app because I can listen to whatever song whenever I want
4211,App works when it wants,3,8/19/2020 20:33,Even when I have connection the app doesn’t want to play. I have to delete it & redownload for it to work. But when it does it’s the best.
4212,Go+,2,8/18/2020 3:20,After SoundCloud made every song go+ I literally have to move into a new platform because i cant listen to any and im not paying 10$ a month 😐
4213,The best,5,7/13/2020 17:00,This app is great because it’s all free except for the girl but it still works perfectly and it has remixes
4214,You low life’s,1,8/5/2020 12:38,Every once and a while all my music in my liked songs will be only for premium but not on my other account. I don’t want to pay for your app I’ll get Apple Music if I wanted to pay for music and now I just have to not use your app until it resets.
4215,Please read,3,7/30/2020 9:30,Good app but I’m not gonna pay for another music subscription and every song is being added to sound cloud go
4216,👎🏻,2,7/20/2020 5:34,"It was good till the latest update, now it’s just ruined, it’s slow loading tracks,my playlist is gone,and I can’t even search and find my playlist tracks."
4217,What tf u do to the app,1,7/17/2020 13:07,I loved SoundCloud until they made all of my songs preview I pay for enough stuff can’t I just listen to some music while I go to sleep I don’t know if it’s this stupid update or what but who in gods green earth decided to make everyone on my playlist to be preview why
4218,FREE SONGS And many many songs,5,6/4/2020 2:42,I looove this app because it has free apps and rarely any problem
4219,Too many ads,2,6/27/2020 0:45,way too many ads and for some reason when there is an ad and i go to another app the ad stops playing meaning i have to be on the app so the ad can play and it’s annoying
4220,Awful service and execution,1,6/17/2020 12:44,"Can’t scrub through files. Can’t tell when you have listened to a file in a playlist. Will play random crap when you curated your own playlist. Closed ecosystem. 

Only reason I’m here is to follow a single creator and I hate that I’ve been reduced to it."
4221,Endless variety,5,5/19/2020 20:41,I appreciate the endless variety of music!
4222,Remember the times we had,5,5/17/2020 2:53,Stream remember the times we had

Maybe start up your own music who knows maybe you’ll get that shot"
4230,Can’t even make an account,1,4/8/2020 2:46,I’ve been trying for the past 2 years to make an account since I’ve gotten this app and I could never login it’s says “Error loading” “or “network connection error”
4231,My favorite,5,3/23/2020 16:43,"Love it and it’s easy to use, it gives u so much choices for the artists u like .."

4234,Easy to use,4,3/12/2020 3:13,Enjoy using it. User interface could be better for 5 stars
4235,Up next button,2,3/6/2020 20:04,"I don’t understand how you still can’t make an up next list, super easy to make that option. With SoundCloud go you should be able to put a queue of songs"
4236,Soundcloud is one of the best,4,3/3/2020 0:43,Kinda annoying adds but not a problem with sound cloud go
4237,The glitches,2,2/24/2020 20:41,I love this app but it keeps glitching every time I open it and play a song (this was today) it would cut out after a second! I love the music on this app but the glitches need fixed
4238,😡😡 wth,3,2/19/2020 5:08,So basically I turned off my phone and turned it back on and it just kicked me out of my account like for real sound cloud you need to help me I had so much music 😡😡
4239,Review,5,1/25/2020 23:03,This app is lit your don’t need to pay for nothing to listen to your fav music
4240,Why? I want my music!!,1,2/10/2020 0:30,Ok so I went to go listen to my music like usual and they made almost every song go+ like what’s this went from a 5 star app to a 0 literally my whole playlist I can’t even listen to like what is wrong with you people. We chose your app cuz we get free songs... wack.
4241,Save music problem,4,2/8/2020 7:29,Unfortunately you can’t save a music and play it offline.
4242,Glitch,2,2/1/2020 7:29,I’ve been experiencing an issue with SoundCloud where I go to open my playlists from the app and it freezes on that screen and I have to end the app to open back up SoundCloud
4243,Went downhill,1,1/29/2020 14:37,Now you can’t even skip ads they force you to watch through them with your phone open or i get 2 30 second ads in a row probably the best music streaming app cuz they got everything but the ads are retarded and mad long
4244,Decent,3,1/25/2020 20:53,"Great app, however today all my songs on my playlist became Soundcloud Go+ only meaning i can only listen to 30 seconds of it. This makes no sense."
4245,Apple Watch,5,1/12/2020 17:15,Please when will we be able to download the app in Apple Watch
4246,Little to know ads,5,7/27/2022 20:26,!!
4247,Freezing problem,3,8/24/2022 19:22,App constantly freezes. Annoying at best.
4248,Xbox connection does not work,2,8/7/2022 12:37,Would rate higher but it wont even let me cast from my phone to the xbox. Signed in on both and nothing. My internet isn’t to blame either
4249,Fresh new UI,4,7/29/2022 0:42,Whoever designed the new UI as of July 2022 needs to get a raise/ bonus  I’m loving it. I’ve been a longtime user and the new UI feels fresh. One love 🇯🇲
4250,As soon as a competitor comes lol,1,7/28/2022 1:02,"Could be so much less corpo.. less ads, less non-approved follows, no date shown?!? They don’t show when the track came out anymore?! Amazing such a huge plunge this name has taken over the years."
4251,Thumbs up,5,7/11/2022 0:38,New update is great I’ve always loved the app tho
4252,UI update,5,6/12/2022 2:11,I don’t like the layout of the update. The UI is really ugly now.
4253,read this one for sure.,1,6/13/2022 14:49,THIS UPDATE IS DUMB………. it’s no longer letting me listen to my music when I press a song it loads for abt 3 sec. Then it’s says “Loading error” and skips to the next song and that’s all it’s doing. And I have perfectly good wifi… 😤
4254,It’s amazing,5,5/18/2022 21:05,Amazing for new creators and people who just wants to experience
4255,Follow button,3,6/12/2022 0:31,Can you please take off the follow button under the arrow on top? I’ll be accidentally unfollowing my friends just cuz it’s so close
4256,SoundCloud is literally the best,5,3/3/2022 6:54,Only music streaming app i use.
4257,SO MANY ADS!!!,1,5/13/2022 17:48,"It’s definitely not worth getting a normal subscription. And they play full length ads every other song. It’s worse than constantly listening to radio advertisements. 

Too much ads."
4258,Farhan Rizvi,5,2/27/2022 16:57,"Best music app so far
You can enjoy online and offline music"
4259,The best music app,5,2/6/2022 0:06,Can’t seem to find a better app
4260,A,4,2/20/2022 1:13,It’s really good but the only complaint is that theirs too many adds
4261,Add beats,5,1/5/2022 4:37,I feel like you guys need to add to SoundCloud beats instrumentals the wrap off of your record on
4262,Why?,2,1/10/2022 2:18,I got it and it was working perfectly but then it just stopped working and then I deleted it and then tried to re-download it and it just wouldn’t.
4263,Go to playlists all day!,5,12/21/2021 21:44,Can’t wait to be at the top of the hip hop playlist!
4264,Great App but you need to chill on these ads,4,1/2/2022 20:01,Great App but I get a lot of these adds that last a minute a lot.
4265,Haven’t installed because of privacy concern,1,12/29/2021 23:17,"Why is that much data being collected?

Just let me login… you don’t need all that info…… Why are you accessing my search results
Why are you accessing my media
Why do you need my location
Etc…

Don’t follow trend. Build a good service and keep it that way. 

One of the best things I like about SoundCloud is being able to listen to the music that I want to listen to without being poked. Step back."
4266,Great Music,5,10/24/2021 15:15,Always on time never late music.
4267,I amazing app,5,10/10/2021 2:39,I can find the songs I can not find in Apple Music

4269,Get rid of commercials,3,8/26/2021 15:15,I’d give you a 5 star rating if it wasn’t for those super long commercials that you HAVE TO LISTEN TO ! Can’t skip em or anything
4270,Soundcloud,4,7/29/2021 16:41,It a cool app l just wish l could listen to more songs with out paying for them.
4271,Great,5,4/20/2021 23:43,I love how I can just listen to the music even on airplane mode!
4272,The app is so slow :(,3,7/7/2021 16:18,"Firstly, thank you for creating an amazing window for wonderful music and podcasts!

I do so many “Likes” but lately the app is getting so heavy and really slow.
Back then when I had a fewer likes the app was so smooth, but now while am having about 2000 likes this problem appears.

I love ur app. Please fix it :(
& Keep the amazing work <3

Lama."
4273,No queue system,3,7/3/2021 18:11,Yo why does this music hosting app with over 150 million songs only let you queue one song at a time?
4274,Weird changes?,2,4/22/2021 2:27,Definitely paid for SoundCloud pro and for some reason now that I opened the app it’s asking me to join SoundCloud pro and now I can’t chrome cast music to the tv!
4275,Good,5,3/23/2021 23:03,Good app wish there was search history
4276,Dheb,5,3/17/2021 16:45,Some songs on here make me want to kill my self

4281,LOVE SOUNDCLOUD!,5,2/7/2021 21:23,"the best music app i use. if you haven’t experienced soundcloud yet, i highly recommended it:)"
4282,SoundCloud weekly,1,2/18/2021 14:45,SoundCloud weekly is a great idea. However it just plays the same list of songs every weeks. It’s legit barely changed for over a year and I’ve listened and found many new songs.
4283,Glad ur here!!,5,1/25/2021 1:06,Appreciate the huge spectrum of music you provide.
4284,I love this app,5,1/5/2021 21:35,"This app is amazing I can play music whenever I want thank you
:)✌🏼😁"
4285,Still no queue,3,1/18/2021 21:52,Decent app but why is there no queue? That’s a super basic feature of a music app no reason not to have this
4286,Ads,4,1/11/2021 18:26,only thing that throws me off is the ads
4287,Plz fix your “Like” button please,1,1/10/2021 0:22,"I can’t save any of my favorite songs whenever I hit the heart button, it says saved to liked tracks and unlikes. Please fix the “like” button i really wanna listen to my favorite songs 😞"
4288,Comment Sections,3,1/6/2021 5:41,Just remove the comment section from SoundCloud. It’s full of bots and self promoters and I’ve never seen it used in a positive way. Unnecessary feature
4289,How do you put your songs on SoundCloud,5,12/19/2020 23:03,Enjoy
4290,Perfect app for music lovers of anykind,4,12/26/2020 0:28,Would give five stars if the music that’s listed was real 100% of the time
4291,amazing,5,12/4/2020 10:44,i been listing to soundcloud for about a year year but i wasn’t expecting them to make a playlist for your most played songs t the end! all i gotta say is if you need a good music player get soundcloud
4292,This is what I say to that person that lost his music,2,12/4/2020 23:29,Maybe cause u didn’t update the app 🤷🏻‍♀️ just maybe ... and also apps glitch out when u have them for so long
4293,Best app,5,11/25/2020 19:12,And it’s free love how they got songs that other apps or iPhone don’t have
4294,The ‘See more listening history’ button is not working!,2,12/2/2020 23:10,The button won't take me to listening history.
4295,Took my money and stopped my downloads,1,12/2/2020 4:27,I got up to 85 tracks loaded on here and then a block message started poppin up saying “upgrade to pro an start back downloading” so I upgraded and nothin happen.  Just took my money and stopped my loads🤦🏽‍♂️🤬🤬🤬
4296,Best app for listening to music and rap,5,11/11/2020 16:53,I love this app more then must and other music app 🧢🧢👀
4297,So. Many. Ads,4,10/8/2020 15:06,Why can’t I listen to 3 songs without getting an ad
4298,Happy,5,8/31/2020 11:52,"Bro this music app has the most songs, it also includes remixes 😀"

4300,Love this app,5,8/26/2020 23:02,It’s amazing you have so many songs and artist I can find
4301,Awesome,5,8/17/2020 9:36,Great way for creators to interact with fans and like minds. I can also get projects heard. Great variety of music choices.
4302,Not sure how to use this app 😏,4,8/23/2020 12:30,But it has a better sound and better helpful
4303,Change the insight back to the other app,1,8/19/2020 5:57,There’s no point in the creator app now that the insights are on the actual SoundCloud app. It’s not user friendly this way. Also there’s a glitch in the SoundCloud app... now I cannot see my plays it won’t fit on the page.
4304,BaldHead Baddie,5,7/22/2020 19:43,I love SoundCloud because it has music that sometimes Apple doesn’t even have.
4305,Age,4,8/12/2020 14:58,"The age requirement. I’ve been wanting SoundCloud since I was 10, now I’m 11. I’m really gonna have to wait another year, wow pls fix this"
4306,Very Disappointed,1,8/9/2020 7:52,I use to love SoundCloud for years now all of a sudden I got to pay for everything I listen to & the preview songs are just 15 seconds long I have music the I’ve listened to from years ago Now I can only listen to 15 seconds of it . I’m Very Disappointed ! VERY 😔
4307,Love it,5,6/21/2020 7:14,I appreciate all the options of musics and the opportunities they offer the new artists community’s.
4308,Can’t add songs to playlist,3,7/20/2020 23:54,Only option is to create a new playlist but I can no longer add songs to existing playlists. Please fix
4309,pretty good,4,7/20/2020 2:42,i enjoy it i just think that the shameless self promotion on EVERY SONG gets annoying after a while
4310,It’s good,4,7/18/2020 2:32,After a while almost every song needs Go plus
4311,Too many adds,3,6/28/2020 12:53,This app is alright but there is just way too many ads after playing 3 songs
4312,Read immediately,1,6/26/2020 7:31,I don’t know if it’s a glitch but I have to have SoundCloud go for every song so this app is kinda bad and 13 dollars for it that’s a garbage price I would not recommend getting this unless that glitch or whatever it is gets fixed
4313,Hearts,5,6/18/2020 5:38,Love SoundCloud it just takes a lot of time to get to the artist and songs
4314,Almost a 5,4,6/18/2020 21:09,If you guys didn’t make listeners watch certain ads it would be a 5.
4315,I love SoundCloud I’ve been using it for years now the only app I use for music💯💯💯,5,5/22/2020 20:00,I luv it in my young Jeezy voice
4316,Great music app,4,6/16/2020 18:45,Love the monthly subscription I have that’s ad free but for some reason the app won’t open every time I try
4317,An,3,5/31/2020 9:02,Hey the music I want to save doesn’t want it to save i don’t know what to do please help I tried to put the heart but it doesn’t want it to be on my list
4318,Why I like SoundCloud,5,5/19/2020 18:44,I like how I skip to any song I want without a membership
4319,Love it.,5,5/4/2020 11:54,I really loved it when their were no reviews on songs but I still love it.
4320,Amazing app,5,4/13/2020 3:22,Had this app for about 2-3 not once have I been disappointed
4321,Soundcloud,5,4/5/2020 20:40,I love this app it barely has ads and it’s amazing quality
4322,Please change app icon,5,4/3/2020 17:57,"Hi
Your app as musicplayer app it's one of good apps , but please please please change app icon"
4323,Great app!,5,3/24/2020 4:03,I love this app even though it has a few bad things it’s still a good app.
4324,Laggy and glitchy,2,3/24/2020 21:19,When I scroll through my songs it's so laggy and every like 20 songs it'll stop and I have to wait a whole minute to continue it's really tedious and annoying
4325,S,5,3/13/2020 17:41,"It’s a great music app, play music in the background anytime even offline"
4326,How I feel about this app😊,3,3/15/2020 3:59,I like this app so much but sometimes it don’t give you the song you looking for
4327,Awesome,5,2/4/2020 3:06,It is a good app to go to if you want to listen to good music and it has almost every song🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
4328,Likes playlist causing app to freeze.,2,3/8/2020 8:16,"Whenever I go to my liked tracks in my library, I get a never ending loading ball. It freezes. Even after quitting and relaunching the app several times."
4329,Trash,1,3/4/2020 16:04,Use to be free with no ads no bull crap now you can’t listen to more than one song without a minute of ADs playing. I understand ADs bring in more money for the app but going to lose long time app users cause you’ve just ruined the app🤡
4330,Can’t listen to anymore music,1,2/22/2020 21:49,Supposably I can’t listen to soundcloud music anymore cause of the fact that every artist I listen too now has soundcloud Go and there was no soundcloud go before so now I’ll stop listening to soundcloud until this is fixed
4331,Still can’t see track descriptions,1,2/19/2020 16:20,It’s incredible that this feature has been missing for so many years. You would think such an important feature would have been addressed a long time ago.
4332,Very excellent,5,1/31/2020 22:43,This is great because it allows me to listen to song
4333,Why ?,2,2/3/2020 6:09,I was just listening to all my songs as full songs like 3 hours ago and I just got back on and now they’re all go+ and all I get is 30 second pre views like ??? This is ridiculous.
4334,Thank you,5,1/21/2020 4:26,easy access thank you soundCloud
4335,I love BTS,4,1/31/2020 13:41,It won’t let me block this dude because I don’t know him. I looked it up online and it doesn’t give me the option to block him.
4336,Increase in ads is disappointing,2,1/27/2020 14:44,"App has been great for years now, but you can see they’re selling their soul to corporations for adds, every day it gets worse and worse. Just disappointing that’s all."
4337,A miracle,5,1/8/2020 22:38,The only thing I would like to do is play more music on the app
4338,Amazing,5,1/7/2020 4:06,This app has the best songs everyone needs to download this!!!
4339,SoundCloud,5,9/3/2022 22:57,It’s the best app to listen to whatever music u like
4340,Excellent,5,9/1/2022 1:16,Easy to use to hear the music I like.
4341,The New Update Ruined Everything,1,9/2/2022 0:41,"I can’t see my own playlists anymore, search for songs, click on a new track to play, or even see any of my own tracks on my profile."
4342,Great!,5,8/15/2022 18:31,Thank you for fixing the shuffle bug SoundCloud goated again 💯😭
4343,Can’t shuffle my playlist,1,8/17/2022 0:17,"Why do I need to pay to shuffle my own playlist😐
SoundCloud is so stupid now now I have to go back on the app to pick out songs that I want to listen to instead of just shuffling all my music"
4344,This is awesome,5,7/9/2022 18:41,I have found the dumbest song on here and here and I love it
4345,Ads Ads Ads,1,7/27/2022 14:54,Another company more focused on ad revenue than anything else. Open app..play one song…press next…AD…plays two songs you don’t typically listen to  (algorithm at work) so you press next and then another AD!
4346,Amazing app keep up the good work I really like what you did,5,6/12/2022 3:47,5 star Amazing appp
4347,Go back to the older 2021 update features,1,6/13/2022 18:07,It was 5 star. You can’t really see names of songs but big pictures of the uploaded songs. It’s hard to see the letters. Go back to the old feature.
4348,I can no longer play songs,1,6/13/2022 14:50,"The Home Screen isn’t working properly and I can’t play any songs anymore. I hope
this can be fixed quickly as reading is a lot more fun with music."
4349,Horrible loading,1,6/13/2022 13:56,Pray that your internet is 10/10 or your going to have a hard time using this app I have full bars lte plan with Verizon and it won’t load even my liked tracks meanwhile Apple Music is flyin

4352,It’s good just one prob,4,5/26/2022 14:54,It is good but it keeps on skipping some songs on my playlist so plz fix that
4353,AN INSUFFERABLE AMOUNT OF ADS,1,5/3/2022 5:53,"I pay for Apple Music because it has more music options, but I like to use SoundCloud for music I can't find on Apple Music. There is a minute worth of ads every two songs and it is so insufferable that I've given up on this app."
4354,Highly recommend,5,4/29/2022 23:06,This app is amazing
4355,SoundCloud,5,4/11/2022 11:20,They have the best music with really good bass on my Sound-system
4356,Bridge to Happiness.,5,3/26/2022 17:08,It is unwise to ignore the masses. Lend your ear. You may be suprised what you dig up. Lots of starving artists out there. Help them.
4357,Love sound cloud,5,3/14/2022 22:17,It’s is a awesome app I can listen to any song
4358,It's Great but.....,5,2/22/2022 1:23,The app is wonderful and all but could we please get it back on apple watches.
4359,Playlist ads,1,3/2/2022 22:27,I guess paying for a plan isn’t enough to keep the ads away. I don’t want to be notified that a new “playlist” is available at the top of my screen. Absolutely ridiculous.
4360,I love this app,5,2/14/2022 14:36,The only problem I have with it is they need mote of $uicideboy$ music
4361,Good I like that,5,1/29/2022 3:50,Good I like that because anytime find mood or quite

4368,Shady. Charging me two subscriptions,1,10/30/2021 21:32,Yeah I just cancelled and never coming back. Watch out you don’t get screwed by them by charging you two subscriptions at the same time. It’s not clear AT ALL but that’s the intent with this low rent music app

4376,Trash,1,8/11/2021 5:35,It's doodoo too much ads once u go dine in your playlist it won't even let u click old songs it's just slow and a waste of storage too many bugs they haven't fixed yet just don't download

4413,Great exposure.,5,7/31/2020 16:35,Can’t complain  it seems like it’s a legit solid free platform to express your content.
4414,It’s the best,5,5/24/2020 21:00,It has songs that aren’t even released and it’s absolutely amazing
4415,Terrible,1,7/30/2020 19:55,I used to love soundcloud when all the songs werent sound cloud go + now you pretty much have to pay $12 just to listen to any song i mean the free version you can still listen to alot of songs just limited to some though
4416,Unable to use,3,7/23/2020 14:46,Bought a subscription and haven’t been able to use
4417,Go+ my entire playlist after update,1,7/8/2020 15:14,"My entire 3hour playlist was immediately reduced to nothing after it was all Go plused and now there's absolutely no music to listen to, that was going far too overboard"
4418,I love soundcloud but,4,7/2/2020 19:45,i love soundcloud but i would love it even more if we could change our playlist names 🙂
4419,What the heck?,2,6/24/2020 14:36,Sooo the app is very good but I’m just confused on how none of the song I had on playlists need SoundCloud go not today when I wake up all of them need SoundCloud go what’s up with that? Now I can’t listen to any of my songs
4420,Glitchy,3,6/7/2020 1:42,"been using soundcloud since I was in 6th grade (2012), and the app has never been this glitchy. hope this gets fixed"

4468,Too many ads,1,12/31/2021 18:19,There are ads after every two or three songs. Ridiculous. I should have never updated the app because now all I get is bombarded with ads
4469,Great,5,11/30/2021 1:20,It’s great and you don’t have to pay money
4470,Pretty bad,2,12/2/2021 13:37,Why I’m I paying $12 a month when you can’t listen to music offline. What’s the point? Almost all the songs on go+ are old rock songs.
4471,One of my favorite platforms but…,5,11/16/2021 15:29,Please make an Apple Watch app🥺

4474,TOO MANY ADS!!!,1,10/10/2021 5:31,"They have an obscene amount of ads in the hope
to make you pay for the unlimited version. Bit excessive for a music platform. Definitely recommend Musi or literally anything else!"

4476,Not for when ur in ur feels,2,8/29/2021 3:56,It’s good overall has a lot of songs but the ads are too much for a music app like when ur in ur feels and u tryna sync with the music an ad comes on talking bout deodorant
4477,Love it!!,5,8/6/2021 1:29,It’s easy to find new people and listen to good music. It’s such a great app 😍

4482,Music Playground,5,6/28/2021 2:50,Playground for people looking for music to listen to and for composers to post to.

4502,Not that good,3,12/16/2020 16:30,To many ads I play 2 3 songs and a ad pops up and we have to pay to hear music
4503,Keeps shutting off,2,12/13/2020 17:40,The app keeps closing after about 10-15 minutes of play. Anyone else having the same issue?
4504,adds,1,12/11/2020 17:54,"i can’t tell if SoundCloud is forcing us to get SoundCloud go + because their giving us adds every two songs, might delete it if this is how it’s going to be, we just want to listen to music for free."

4519,Sound cloud,5,6/20/2020 13:26,"Great quality sound, easy navigation and I love
It!"
4520,Pathetic and shady,1,7/6/2020 20:22,They charge artists to put their music on and then pay them nothing for ads run on their videos. Indie artists are PAYINY for the privilege of allowing you to make money off of their hard work. You are pathetic and should be ashamed of yourselves. I hope you all get sick and suffer.

4540,SoundCloud,3,3/24/2020 3:50,It’s good and everything but most of the songs I want to listen to aren’t on there and it would be better if you guys supported it with Siri

4639,4 and a half  I LOVE ITT,4,3/8/2020 16:09,The app is awesome but the only thing that might be the problem is that people can follow you like on instagram etc but otherwise I LOVE it
4640,Sound investment,5,2/4/2020 3:18,Great way to spend time in carefree listening!
4641,Why,4,3/5/2020 2:41,Because you have to pay for GO+ but other than that it is a really great app

4652,So annoyed because of the ads,3,8/15/2022 0:46,Too many advertisements
4653,Sound cloud,4,7/29/2022 17:44,Very good and reliable but wish there was no adds but very good app
4654,what,2,7/29/2022 13:32,where's the queue button when some track played? Why was it removed??? I used it before so it was convenient.
4655,Not worth it,1,7/10/2022 16:13,You don’t provide anything positive to music. I truly wish you would’ve went out of business years ago like you were supposed to. Absolutely cannot stand SC anymore. Good riddance.
4656,Ads ruined it,1,7/9/2022 9:38,"Too many ads. It litterly is ruined by ads, an ad after every single song. An ad when you open the app before you even play a song."
4657,BandLab,5,6/11/2022 7:12,I enjoy working off of this app it’s so convenient
4658,So many adds,3,6/16/2022 16:25,Way to many add its like every 4 songs I get 2 adds not even worth using
4659,SoundCloud,5,5/30/2022 17:20,It’s SoundCloud. Never crashed. Audio Quality great.

4676,Won’t let me cancel,1,7/30/2021 4:06,Please stay away from this app. Not only do they promote the most wicked music out there but once you sign up for a subscription (from my experience) they don’t allow you to cancel.

4688,Forced Account Generation,1,3/23/2021 2:02,"Forces users to create an account just to use an app, when the actual website does not require one. Account equals tracking. Tracking equals no privacy. I will not create an account... app deleted."
4689,🥺,3,3/7/2021 0:21,I love sound cloud but there something that I don’t like is that we can not hear  music whit out internet no more 🥺
4690,Ads!,2,3/3/2021 16:39,It’s so embarrassing on how many adds there are... at least make the adds 15 second instead of 2 30 second adds

4694,Great,5,12/28/2020 18:55,Overall I love it and I can play whatever I want
4695,My god please fix the constant crashes,2,1/18/2021 20:04,Well the crashes were fixed but here we are again
4696,Very disappointed,1,1/10/2021 4:29,I’m very upset I can no longer use SoundCloud because my phone does not go up to 13.0 but only goes to IOS 12.5 so I cannot update it and cannot listen to my favorite music please fix
4697,Hard,5,11/25/2020 2:51,Got hard
4698,Free,5,10/22/2020 16:09,I love how this app is free and barely has any adds but lots of music
4699,Too many adds.,1,11/24/2020 18:28,"There is an unskippable add every 2-3 songs, and it can’t even be played in the background. I know it’s meant to coax us into getting “Soundcloud GO”, but really it just makes me want to delete the app."
4700,It’s ok,4,11/21/2020 16:44,I love this app so much but I do i really have to pay money for my favorite songs
4701,The ads,1,11/15/2020 23:25,I get two 30 second un-skipable ads after every one or two songs. Just too many ads and there’s no way I’m paying more than I pay for Apple Music just to listen ad free
4702,🤦🏾‍♂️,2,11/5/2020 16:54,I logged into my account this morning and it keeps saying I have no connection and I have music posted on there what’s going on sound cloud
4703,The Glitches The Glitches!!!,5,10/4/2020 19:49,"I Love SoundCloud, But I have something to complain about. The Glitches. They are so Annoying! And scrolling threw my likes to, And sending & reposting stuff. Whenever I scroll threw my likes, everything goes really slow & my phone freezes, Then I have to wait 5 minutes for my phone to unfreeze so I can go threw my likes to find a song I like. And reposting stuff also including adding stuff to playlists & sending stuff to people, Whenever I wanna repost a song or Send a song to someone or add a song to a playlist in my likes, Everytime I click on the menu button to repost it. Sometimes it doesn’t pop up. So I have to exit SoundCloud and find the song again. And when I’m scrolling down accounts. Like my account, My Account is •Your D@IL¥ D0$€ OF AN!M€• And Everytime I scroll down any account, Mostly everyone’s EXECPT mine, Cause when I scroll down. Everything glitches. And sometimes when I wanna play a song and I click on it. My screen freezes for a second then glitches back to the home screen. And The adds Oh my god. STOP IT WITH THE VAPING ADDS! I KNOW THAT IM A TEEN AND IM NEVER GOING TO VAPE BUT EVERYTIME THE VAPING ADDS COME UP IT MAKES ME WANNA VAPE!! And when I’m listening to music and I’m in another app. Sometimes the song stops and I get confused so I check what Happened. And Uhm apparently it sometimes has to load back into SoundCloud— I’d really like the glitches to go away— And for the vaping adds to show up less, I would like movie adds and Object adds and Other adds. I don’t want Vaping adds because Everytime I see & or hear one, It makes me wanna vape. So please stop the vaping adds."
4704,Too many ads,1,10/8/2020 19:30,I’ve been listening to and using soundcloud for years and I have never ran into as many ads as I have in the past couple of months.
4705,AWESOME. CRAZY AWESOME,5,9/14/2020 15:39,Love it! But 1 problem. Sometimes It doesn’t load and I can’t listen to it offline
4706,Orange white,5,8/27/2020 20:32,"I can fight, with smooth flows, with no hacking my goals. I’ll make it far in the music industry. Billion dollar maker man."

4710,Free sound cloud only has the first 30 seconds of each song,1,7/21/2020 15:09,They’re doing anything to make you pay. With today’s update every album and song I had saved will no long play 👍 Apple Music it is

4713,SoundCloud,5,7/3/2020 17:42,Best music app so underrated I would recommend this music app over any
4714,oh my.,1,7/9/2020 14:58,"they just made like 90% of the popular songs unable to be listened to without the 20$ a month GO+ subscription. 
theres basically nothing to listen to without paying. i can no longer recommend this app."
4715,They just want money,1,7/5/2020 15:14,They just ramped the amount of songs that require a premium membership and now my entire playlist is more or less useless I’d rather go buy Apple Music then give SoundCloud a dime with y’all ads every two song absolute trash app.👎🏽
4716,Disgusting,1,7/4/2020 15:09,I’ve used soundcloud for awhile now but now all my songs are go+. I’m not buying go+ so I have to make a new account and add all my songs again and they are not go+ songs it just a scam trying to get people to pay for go+. What a disgusting platform

4726,Basically unusable,1,5/22/2020 10:44,"I restart my phone with the app open ONCE and now I can’t get a second into a song without it jumping around or straight up freezing. Of course ads work PERFECTLY, no surprise there, but otherwise the app is practically unusable.

5122,Ads,1,7/20/2020 14:58,There’s an ad after every 3 songs. This app is trash and annoying. You can’t even listen to every song because you have to pay for it. You have to pay for songs and ad free music. It’s wack.
5123,Loop playlist please,3,7/19/2020 21:28,Can we get the play list on loop button again for iPhone? I can only loop the song not the whole playlist

5131,Great app,5,4/19/2020 2:35,I like it cause my son is a dj music producer and I could listen to the new songs

5140,+,3,3/11/2020 1:50,All my songs are go+ now and it’s really annoying. If u want your app to do well maybe don’t make every single song go+

5246,Songs,1,1/27/2020 16:42,"I had been using this app for a while and all the songs that I listen to, turned into SoundCloud Go only songs. Fix this. If I can listen to music for free before, it shouldn’t be taken away now"
5247,SoundCloud Go+,1,1/11/2020 18:30,I understand that it’s a way to make money. But you can’t put songs that are preview only when customers can literally go to any other streaming service and listen to the same music
5248,Great but for the previews,5,1/6/2020 14:35,U have to play remixes of the song sometimes
5249,What updates,2,1/6/2020 22:11,Y’all always say y’all do updates and bug fixes and improvements but never seen anything done so I ask? What updates are y’all talking about?

5254,Not reasonable,3,6/26/2022 23:47,I spend 16$ a month for this and still can’t listen to all the music what’s that all about
5255,Force,2,7/28/2022 16:22,They force to many ad on u so try to make u pay. Pretty controlling if u ask me. And the longer u have it the worse it gets.
5256,Ads after EVERY SINGLE SONG,1,6/20/2022 16:04,I understand I don’t have premium but come on now. This is the worst listening experience ever. There shouldn’t be an ad after EVERY SINGLE SONG I PLAY. Just a bunch of money hungry leeches running this app.
5257,New update problems,1,6/13/2022 22:40,Anytime I try to play anything now it just says loading error and I can’t play anything. There’s a new interface but the app is literally unusable
5258,Cwts chevy,5,5/28/2022 15:26,It’s perfect for when your about to hop in the shower perfect audio

5362,Update broke app,1,6/13/2022 15:40,"Downloaded the app to check on my messages and everything, nothing will load! I tried everything including a vpn, nothing."
5363,USED to be awesome not so much anymore,1,6/13/2022 13:49,Every update that’s brought to SoundCloud ultimately is the most laggy and infuriating experience. I mean there’s a whole tab just to buy their premium subscription. Shady and sad. Make SC great again

5567,Falsely Reporting Tracks,4,6/20/2022 9:09,"I have had to reach out towards independent artists in the result of visualizing certain tracks that were once on my playlist and/or albums that were erroneously removed due to false reporting. In no way these certain independent artists violated any terms nor exhibited copyrighted infringement. If it wasn’t for the fact that I took the necessary precautions in writing down all tracks on my playlist and downloading these files in order to backup and safely secure the tracks on my profile, I would have been very displeased. Granted I understand updates may play a role on certain tracks to be removed but since I was able to investigate the random tracks it seems that an individual decided to falsely report certain tracks due to its lyrical content. By no means these lyrics that were being projected to the public were offensive nor in violation. I understand that if a track is being questioned that the track will be removed temporarily for further review. However this is an individual who is following my profile and is doing this as an act of spiteful retaliation. There are times where certain tracks with “Hollywood” artists are removed and needed to be resubmitted into a playlist. I have reached out to certain independent artists in raising this awareness because certain ones were unaware of the situation, when it comes to their tracks being falsely reported. This has affected my professional process in engaging a network base with these artists, musicians, lyricist, producers, vocalists, digital sound techs (whether independent or rising). My suggestion if taken under consideration is if the developer could gray out the track if indeed the track would be under review just like it would for tracks that are not available in the U.S. until it is valid, and if not then deactivate in order for the listener to enjoy its musical content."

6183,To many ads,2,6/26/2022 22:15,Way to many ads I get I’m not paying but it’s every other song
6184,new update,1,6/20/2022 15:53,really don’t like the new update and how the whole interface looks different. there was absolutely nothing wrong with the old one so i don’t see a reason to change it. also often while i’m listening it will just freeze up and i have to completely close out of the app to get it to work again
6185,the new update is ugly,1,6/17/2022 22:08,it’s like they updated it for people who can’t see. everything is HUGE for no reason at all. it’s really ugly and annoying to use.

6225,iOS,1,12/13/2020 5:52,You can’t download this app without iOS 13 or about. Apple are you serious. It’s a MUSIC APP. You guys are ridiculous. If I could leave less than 1 Star I would. Absolutely terrible
6226,Exceptionally long and annoying ads.,1,12/12/2020 3:52,This is a one star app until you drop Betadyne. I have to close it any time an ad comes on. Awful.

6341,Ads after every song,1,7/27/2020 1:37,Really? 1 or 2 songs at most before an ad? Ads before and after almost every song to force you into Soundcloud Go. Dumb.
6342,i want a “play next” button!,3,7/25/2020 22:45,"i love the app, i just wish there were less ads and there needs to be a queue button please
