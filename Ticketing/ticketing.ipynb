    "<h3> The Problem </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "My background before I entered the Masters in Business Analytics program was Seattle University was in event production and I continue to produce events to this day. Ticketing Providers take a large percentage of every transaction and I sought out alternate options to avoid what are often exporbitant fees.\n",
    "While I was impressed by Linktree's 'Request Payment' Feature from a Patron/UX perspective, there were some disadvantages. As someone who throws events often with hundreds of attendees, this information wasn't provided\n",
    "in a centralized database anywhere either in an online portal or as an exportable csv (at least at the time of this project). While using Linktree, which take a miniscule fee of 0.5% for Pro Plan Transactions would save at a minimumum hundreds of dollars in ticketing fees, this was a major issue that would have resulted in hours and hours of manual data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> The Solution </h3>\n",
    "Every time a user submitted a payment, I received an email notification. While the information was buried inside the body of the email, it was there.\n",
    "Google's Takeout feature provides an MBOX File containing all email information. From here, I converted this MBOX File to a CSV, but all the important information was contained in just a single cell on each row\n",
    "and this information was structured in a way that didn't allow for easier parsing of information through a program such as Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this information structured in a more coherent manner would allow for easier tracking of financial information for the event and allowed for a simpler list that could be used at the door when checking\n",
    "patrons in. In addition, providing a streamlined CSV containing information such as the day of the week of a ticket purchase and the time would provide a suitable foundation for conducting further analysis. "
